21:24 <+IronWolf> that song is actually fitting
21:24 <+IronWolf> considering what happens when you get hit with the POMF cannon
21:24 <+Lambo> i love that the cannon for the P39 is is in the center of the plane
21:24 <+Exposure> and I don't really mind missing its absence in HB since my usual engagement ranges in HB tends to be so close I wouldn't need the indicator anyway. :P

22:43 <+Exposure> I was just rewatching the peace flyer video and realized that guy who rammed you caused you to dip to 80 km/h in speed according to the indicator
22:43 <+Exposure> it's just that since WoWP has no sense of physics whatsoever it doesn't look like you just went from around 250km/h to 80km/h
22:44 <+Exposure> I mean, http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/war-thunder-anyone-else-playing.247529/page-57#post-11068844 - a series of gifs with relatively low FPS can still show off a sense of motion for War Thunder.

23:17 < zeit__> how so exposure?
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> [13:17] <zeit__> how so exposure?
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> better deals from publishers
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> Because they're making more money off of games
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> per-unit
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> since, well, no used sales
23:18 <@|Minow|> LunchWolf: depends on what you use your hellcat for
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> so instead of selling 1 real copy for like every 2 or 3 players
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> they sell 1 real copy per player
23:18 <@|Minow|> I use my hellcat mostly as a bomber
23:18 <+Exposure> Emmjay_XII: Actually, used games is a pretty big thing for brick and mortar stores, right?
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> yes
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> Exposure where is this?
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> actually
23:18 <@|Minow|> because now that bomb radii have been nerfed, rockets are better for hitting tanks
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> I want to rub it in someon'es face

23:19 <+Lambo> that should be an option for the Lancaster :(
23:19 <@|Minow|> they won't
23:19 <+Exposure> anyway, I aws thinking since that apparently a lot of pre-order DLC is stuff brick and mortar stores want in exchange for stocking games
23:19 <@|Minow|> best you can do is the 4,000 lb for the Welly :~(
23:19 <+Exposure> (IE it was the reason why ranger mode was a pre-order bonus, Gamestop wanted /something/ as a pre-order bonus for them)
23:19 <+Exposure> so if publishers can feel free to not give a fuck about brick and mortar stores...
23:20 <+Thanatos> 4
23:20 <+Thanatos> [16:18] <+Lambo> when will WT give me the Grand Slam?

23:20 <+Lambo> you're fired.

23:20 <+Lambo> come on
23:20 <+Lambo> who doesn't want that?
23:20 <+Lambo> lol
23:20 <+Emmjay_XII> but yeah
23:20 <+Thanatos> I know that :p
23:20 <+Emmjay_XII> I think a lot of people going 'USED GAMES ARE AWESOME'
23:20 <+Thanatos> I was referencing Denny's
23:21 <+Emmjay_XII> really should take a look at PC gaming
23:21 <+Emmjay_XII> which is like
23:21 <+Emmjay_XII> ultra-super-healthy
23:21 <+Lambo> Thanatos, that's why you're fired
23:21 <+Exposure> Emmjay_XII: I am now imagining a situation where ME4 is announced, day one DLC is announced...
23:21 <+Exposure> except for Xbox One copies, which get the day one dlc for free. :P
23:21 <+LYNX_Mageknight> Doy
23:21 <+LYNX_Mageknight> 10,000 KGs of ouch
23:22 <+Thanatos> [16:20] <+Emmjay_XII> ultra-super-healthy
23:22 <+ES_Corp> Emmjay_XII: And how people (like me) haven't bought a game not from Steam in years.
23:22 <+Thanatos> Only because of Consoles whipping them into shape :p[
23:22 <+Lambo> I buy my digital games from Amazon and Steam
23:22 <+Thanatos> "Hey I need you guys to make everything playable on this"
23:22 <+Lambo> it just ends up being that the games I get on Amazon are steam games.
23:22 <+Lambo> I've not purchased a physical game in years
23:23 <+Thanatos> Also, remember that free game from Origin
23:23 <+Thanatos> For SimCity
23:23 <+Thanatos> I never got it because I closed the window to think about it
23:23 <+Lambo> lol
23:23 <+Thanatos> And there was no way to get it back D:
23:23 < EricD> Welp
23:23 <+Lambo> I got NFS from it
23:23 < EricD> Back to Historical battles for exp
23:23 < EricD> ...If I get Sicily one more time I'm going to be very upset
23:24 < zeit__> ericd
23:24 < zeit__> seeing the hobbit has made me a tolkien fan.
23:24 < zeit__> *EricD
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> [13:21] <+Thanatos> Only because of Consoles whipping them into shape :p[
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> Hey I'm saying that if consoles don't have used games anymore
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> that's not gonna hurt consoles overmuch
23:24 < EricD> Congratulations
23:24 < zeit__> Thanks.
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> Game Dev Tycoon should have simulated console sales
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> so you get sales over the first 2 weeks
23:24 < zeit__> By the way, do you smoke a ppipe?
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> and then NOTHING
23:24 < zeit__> *pipe
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> because everyone's buying used
23:25 < zeit__> just seemed likesomething you would do.
23:25 < EricD> The Hobbit is a really good book too
23:25 < zeit__> I should read it.
23:25 <+Thanatos> Only God Forgives
23:25 <+Thanatos> Is going to be awesome or awesomely terrible
23:25 <+LunchWolf> |Minow|: I suck at hitting things not-airborne with rockets though

00:10 < FalseProphet> I didn't want flaps
00:10 < FalseProphet> I wanted pitch up and down
00:10 < Laird> So now the rage in the SB e3 thread isn't about xboner policy. It is people yelling at other people because they like to buy games new.
00:11  * Laird face palm.
00:11 < FalseProphet> flaps are the things on DBs to slow them down
00:11 < FalseProphet> they are not the alierons like people were saying
00:11 < zeit_> is that a used games thing laird?
00:12 < Laird> Not even that.
00:12 <+Lambo> hahaha
00:12 <+Lambo> god the P39 is cruel
00:12 <+Lambo> i finally have a plane that can chase down A20Gs
00:12 < Laird> People are raging at people for simply buying "new games" instead of buying "used games"
00:12 <+Lambo> and then feed them the lovely 37mm shell!
00:12 < zeit_> ....
00:12 < zeit_> what...
00:13 < Laird> exactly.
00:13 < zeit_> how....who? Why?
