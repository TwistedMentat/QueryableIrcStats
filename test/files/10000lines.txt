21:24 <+IronWolf> that song is actually fitting
21:24 <+IronWolf> considering what happens when you get hit with the POMF cannon
21:24 <+Lambo> i love that the cannon for the P39 is is in the center of the plane
21:24 <+Exposure> and I don't really mind missing its absence in HB since my usual engagement ranges in HB tends to be so close I wouldn't need the indicator anyway. :P

22:43 <+Exposure> I was just rewatching the peace flyer video and realized that guy who rammed you caused you to dip to 80 km/h in speed according to the indicator
22:43 <+Exposure> it's just that since WoWP has no sense of physics whatsoever it doesn't look like you just went from around 250km/h to 80km/h
22:44 <+Exposure> I mean, http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/war-thunder-anyone-else-playing.247529/page-57#post-11068844 - a series of gifs with relatively low FPS can still show off a sense of motion for War Thunder.

23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> [13:17] <zeit__> how so exposure?
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> better deals from publishers
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> Because they're making more money off of games
23:17 <+Emmjay_XII> per-unit
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> since, well, no used sales
23:18 <@|Minow|> LunchWolf: depends on what you use your hellcat for
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> so instead of selling 1 real copy for like every 2 or 3 players
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> they sell 1 real copy per player
23:18 <@|Minow|> I use my hellcat mostly as a bomber
23:18 <+Exposure> Emmjay_XII: Actually, used games is a pretty big thing for brick and mortar stores, right?
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> yes
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> Exposure where is this?
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> actually
23:18 <@|Minow|> because now that bomb radii have been nerfed, rockets are better for hitting tanks
23:18 <+Emmjay_XII> I want to rub it in someon'es face

23:19 <+Exposure> anyway, I aws thinking since that apparently a lot of pre-order DLC is stuff brick and mortar stores want in exchange for stocking games
23:19 <@|Minow|> best you can do is the 4,000 lb for the Welly :~(
23:19 <+Exposure> (IE it was the reason why ranger mode was a pre-order bonus, Gamestop wanted /something/ as a pre-order bonus for them)
23:19 <+Exposure> so if publishers can feel free to not give a fuck about brick and mortar stores...

23:22 <+Thanatos> Only because of Consoles whipping them into shape :p[
23:22 <+Lambo> I buy my digital games from Amazon and Steam
23:22 <+Thanatos> "Hey I need you guys to make everything playable on this"
23:22 <+Lambo> it just ends up being that the games I get on Amazon are steam games.
23:22 <+Lambo> I've not purchased a physical game in years
23:23 <+Thanatos> Also, remember that free game from Origin
23:23 <+Thanatos> For SimCity
23:23 <+Thanatos> I never got it because I closed the window to think about it

23:24 < EricD> Congratulations

23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> and then NOTHING
23:24 < zeit__> *pipe
23:24 <+Emmjay_XII> because everyone's buying used

00:16 < Laird> even if discounted?
00:16 < Wakka> I'd say it is
00:17 < Laird> People are raging at others even over that.
00:17 <+Exposure> SleepIsEasy: Well, Drew Karpyshyn wasn't involved with the DA series AFAIK
00:17 <+Exposure> so that's one plus already :P

00:17 < zeit_> Really?
00:17 < Laird> ya
00:18 < Wakka> The only used game I bought was a $10 copy of Rome + Rome: BI. But then, it was really cheap and I happened to be in the store
00:18 < zeit_> *schatten
00:18 < zeit_> what the hell.
00:18 < Wakka> I mean...if you /want/ to buy release day...okay. Personally I'd wait to see what people outside of paid games "journalists" think of it though

00:28 <+Lambo> so I went "fuck bombers"

00:28 <+Lambo> and offed the P39
00:28 <+LunchWolf> but by the time I got there you seemed to have things pretty handled.

00:52 <+ariqz> owning a house isn't what it's cracked up to be. Tons of liability, you don't really get your way, and you have to pay taxes which is a lot like renting it out from the gov anyway.

01:08 <+Lambo> |Minow|: in an earlier match I shot down 2 A20Gs with one hit from my P39
01:08 <+Lambo> the fact the P39 can keep up with them
01:08 <+Lambo> makes it even better
01:08 <+RangerKarl> gotta start from altitude and keep following them until they turn, for me

01:33 <+RangerKarl> also
01:33 <+ariqz> mellian: you could join a cult, it's a lot like joining the military 
01:33 <+RangerKarl> B-29s in IL2 are super tough

01:34 < mellian> Psych eval? yes, pretty sure I have no literally issues beyond spacebattles taking my sanity
01:34 < Admiral_Skippy> Laird: Well if she's like an airforce mechanic, she could take the view that helping maintain a bunch of toys that probably won't ever be seriously used is a vaguely neutral act from a pacifist perspective
01:35 < mellian> and grew up more in last 2-3 years too
01:35 < mellian> more ready mentally
01:35 < Admiral_Skippy> mellian: Awesome : )
01:35 <+ariqz> the fact you were rejected is a gift, mellian, a gift!
01:35 < Admiral_Skippy> Falchion: Well that character is a little of the deep end then lol
01:35 < Admiral_Skippy> Falchion: But the very fact that you're worrying about it means that you can recognise that- and so you're fine, actually
01:35 <+Lambo> LunchWolf: love those screenshots lol
01:36 < mellian> just means I join the forces in my third decade of life instead of my second
01:36 <+ariqz> mellian: why do you think that's such a good idea?
01:36 <+TM_Work> cause she wants to?
01:36 <+ariqz> but sometimes people just like the idea of things when they hate the reality
01:37 < Admiral_Skippy> Falchion: If you're like how I used to be a couple years ago, I would say you're maybe wanking a little bit over "Oh wow I'm so dark and maybe I'm a sociopath!", because that's actually a way to feel a little bit cool, and not think about or engage with other stuff?
01:37 <+ariqz> me, I think smoking cigars sounds lovely. In reality I hate the way they taste, and they make me sick.
01:37 <+Commander_598> The dude I hang out with the most around here and who I went to bootcamp with is 37.

01:45 < I00thlurker> He's like Mackie, except instead of alchohol he drowns in animoo
01:45 < mellian> It is east for existing CF members to verify other members
01:45 < I00thlurker> :p
01:45 <+LunchWolf> of your 37mm going right through him
01:45 <+LunchWolf> too much
01:45 < mellian> easy
01:45 <+Lambo> lol
01:45 <+Lambo> that's the best one
01:45 <+Lambo> and you can see the contrail from the round
01:45 <+ariqz> failing at joining the military is like failing at failing ):
01:45 <+Lambo> going all the way to my plane lol
01:45 < I00thlurker> @ Mellian yeah, IXJac never called Xort into question 
01:46 < mellian> ariqsz, stop describing the US military
01:46 <+RangerKarl> I killed 4 asshats in my derp P-40
01:46 < I00thlurker> or any of our other military members for that matter
01:46 <+LunchWolf> I just like the ominous feeling
01:46 <+LunchWolf> of the first one
01:46 <+LunchWolf> like
01:46 <+LunchWolf> "OH SHIT"
01:46 <+LunchWolf> plus it shows those l33t sniper skills
01:46 <+Thanatos> One thing I like
01:46 <+Thanatos> Is that I can have one hand on the stick
01:46 <+Thanatos> The other on my mouse
01:46 <+Thanatos> And looking around
01:46 < Laird> wheres my sequel to the last starfighter?:(
01:47 <+Lambo> Thanatos, hat switch!
01:47 <+RangerKarl> there isn't any
01:47 <+RangerKarl> it was the last, remember?
01:47 <+Thanatos> Not even remotely as good Lambo :p
01:47 <+Lambo> i know
01:47 <+Lambo> lol
01:47 <+Lambo> need trackir
01:47 <+RangerKarl> >hat switch
01:47 <+RangerKarl> goddamn casuals
01:47 <+Thanatos> Also my hat switch
01:47 <+Thanatos> Activates guns
01:47 <+RangerKarl> ...lol
01:47 <+Lambo> no trigger?
01:47 < mellian> anyway, many of my friends look at me funny with my interest in eventually joining the Canadian Forces
01:47 <+Thanatos> No no
01:47 <+Thanatos> Its an error
01:47 <+RangerKarl> why is your POV switch functioning as DX controls as well
01:47 <+Thanatos> The hat switch no matter what I do
01:47 <+RangerKarl> weird
01:47 <+ariqz> well, mellian. I don't know you very well. To me you are crazy and weird, but I do not think the military fits you at all. Commander_598? It fits him, I don't think I've ever tried to talk him out of iit
01:47 <+Thanatos> Triggers guns
01:48 <+Lambo> lol
01:48 <+RangerKarl> probably shares a dx name with your lmb or something idiotic like that in the game
01:48 <+Falchion> Thanatos: Product feature.
01:48 <+Lambo> LunchWolf, I also love the near miss image
01:48 <+Falchion> Not a flaw.
01:48 < mellian> good thing I do not care what you think ariq :p
01:49 < mellian> been wanting to join the CF since high school
01:49 < EricD> Why always with the wings?
01:49 < EricD> Why do I always get my wings shot up
01:49 < EricD> And then I can't turn worth a shit
01:49 <+Lambo> because
01:49 < mellian> just life stuff got in the way
01:49 <+Lambo> they are very exposed
01:49 < EricD> And turning is the thing Spitfires are supposed to do best
01:49 <+Lambo> sticking out like that and all
01:49 <+ariqz> sometimes fantasies are terrible realities 
01:49 < mellian> derby gave me the confidence I can do it
01:50 <+RangerKarl> [09:49] <EricD> And turning is the thing Spitfires are supposed to do best
01:50 <+Lambo> http://i.imgur.com/9M66TkP.jpg  <-- LunchWolf, I'm sure you want "...wat was that?"
01:50 < mellian> not fantasies
01:50 <+RangerKarl> they also had the support of an exemplary CnC system
01:50 <+Thanatos> [18:47] <+RangerKarl> probably shares a dx name with your lmb or something idiotic like that in the game
01:50 <+Thanatos> Its a miracle it even works
01:50 < mellian> I met and know many folks in the military
01:50 <+RangerKarl> are you using like a gameport stick or something
01:50 <+Thanatos> They support all the force feedback on it
01:50 <+RangerKarl> lel
01:50 < Admiral_Skippy> mellian: I'm sure you'll enjoy it mellian
01:50 <+Thanatos> No
01:50 <+ariqz> is there like, a fake bootcamp mellian can goto?/
01:50 <+Thanatos> Force Feedback 2
01:50 <+RangerKarl> nice 
01:50 <+RangerKarl> very classic
01:51 <+Commander_598> ariqz: Air Force Bootcamp? :p
01:51 <+Lambo> high alt dog fights are best
01:51 < mellian> I was in the air cadets when I little :p
01:51 < Laird> LoL @ the budgey.
01:51 <+Thanatos> Has to be plugged into a socket as well as the PC lol
01:51 <+RangerKarl> oh wow
01:51 <+RangerKarl> lel
01:51 < Laird> I was a guppy
01:52 < mellian> did katimavik, which took youths between 16-21 to form groups place throughout canada doing volunteer work and such
01:52 <+Commander_598> A busload of NJROTC cadets roll through here like every day for the past week or two.
01:52 < mellian> derby, became fit again and working with others as a team in fast action full contact sport
01:53 <+LunchWolf> Lambo: when that little air collision happened I actually went "Oh jesus, I need to back off, flew away for a second to plug a bomber with a few shots, turned back in time to see the other guy bail out."
01:53 <+Commander_598> They all look like they're trying so hard...while still being so wrong.
01:53 < mellian> aptitude testing opens the door to whatever profession in the CF minus ones i cannot due to needing glasses and possibly by this point age/time.
01:53 <+Lambo> lol
01:54 <+Thanatos> Man, apparantly Holmes
01:54 <+Thanatos> Was on a job site once
01:54 <+Thanatos> And leaned on a balcony
01:54 <+Thanatos> And fell through
01:54 <+ariqz> you did not max out aptitude testing. BS :P
01:54 <+Thanatos> And could have easily died if he'd landed wrong
01:54 <+Commander_598> They're definition of uniformity ends at "has khaki pants" and "has shoes".
01:54 <+LunchWolf> Also, put some marks on your plane
01:54 <+TM_Work> Thanatos, Lambo is beating you in the total number of lines
01:54 <+LunchWolf> makes it easier to tell who is who
01:54 <+TM_Work> stop slacking
01:55 <+TM_Work> :p
01:55 <+Thanatos> I don't really care
01:55 <+LunchWolf> Any other interesting stats on me aside from I TALK IN CAPS
01:55 < EricD> God damn Russians
01:55 < mellian> max out the test no, but did make the minimum requirements for all of them
01:55 <+Commander_598> After the past 4-5 months I'm fighting the urge to just go down the line correcting them.
01:55 < mellian> apparently my spatial awareness and cognition pretty damn eye
01:56 < mellian> which I verified with an employment aptitude testing year or so later
01:56 <+ariqz> you have a weak eye? I do too
01:56 < mellian> no, just long distance prescription
01:56 <+ariqz> doctors fucked it up at birth
01:56 <+RangerKarl> I think you degrammar'd a bit there
01:56 <+ariqz> ah
01:56 < mellian> easilly correctible with lasik
01:57 <+Commander_598> I scored very high on the verbal/reading comp. part of the ASVAB.

01:58 <+Commander_598> I've decided it means I can past tests because I'm smart enough to easily comprehend what's wrong in a multiple choice question.
01:58 < Laird> Mellian, is your lasik going to take 3 months of recovery?
01:59 < mellian> I doubt I will get it done before re-applying and if already joined, will be delayed
01:59 <+RangerKarl> should I go watch man of steel
01:59 <+RangerKarl> I figure since it's monday morning literally nobody will be at the cinemas
01:59 <+RangerKarl> so I have free reign
02:00 < mellian> lasik not exactly high priority anyway, more like only if really financial means and time for it

02:11 < EricD> The /fuck/
02:12 <+Lambo> the fuck
02:12 <+LunchWolf> SleepIsEasy: why
02:12 <+LunchWolf> why why why
02:12 <+LunchWolf> also
02:12 <+LunchWolf> mixing syrup and a bath
02:12 <+LunchWolf> why
02:12 < EricD> You know
02:12 < Wakka> 	SleepIsEasy	MEANWHILE IN THE MLP THREAD <---- Every time someone says that I cringe.
02:12 <+Lambo> she's cooking pancakes on that rack
02:13 < EricD> I'd like to see a psychologist do a professional analysis on the brony fandom
02:13 < Wakka> Um
02:13 < EricD> Because I can understand the show being popular amongst it's target demographic
02:13 <+LunchWolf> hahaha
02:13 < EricD> Young girls
02:13 < EricD> I get that
02:13 < EricD> I can even get say the parents having some enjoyment from the show
02:13 < EricD> Lots of cartoons are like that
02:13 < Wakka> I'm pretty sure the syrup/bathtub thing is someone just mixing fetishes all willy nilly
02:13 <+Lambo> Everytime foamy says "MEANWHILE IN THE MLP THREAD" this happens: http://icons.wxug.com/hurricane/2013/lightning_chicago.jpg
02:13 <+Thanatos> [19:09] <+SleepIsEasy> MEANWHILE
02:13 <+Thanatos> [19:09] <+SleepIsEasy> IN THE MLP THREAD
02:13 <+Thanatos> So report it :p
02:14 <+LunchWolf> I don't think it's reportable
02:14 <+LunchWolf> but weird
02:14 < EricD> What I DON'T get is the grown single men who fetishize and sexualize and obsess over this girl's cartoon show
02:14 -!- LunchWolf is now known as IronWolf
02:14 < Wakka> 	EricD	What I DON'T get is the grown single men who fetishize and sexualize and obsess over this girl's cartoon show <--- It's pretty much just the internet sexualizing everything
02:14 <+IronWolf> EricD, keep in mind there are probably people playing War Thunder right now
02:14 < Wakka> Including cats
02:15 <+IronWolf> who are actually so in love with their spitfires
02:15 <+IronWolf> they care taking them on solo-flight dates.
02:15 <@Lord_Squishy> ...what
02:15 < EricD> I'm not in love with my Spitfire
02:15 <+IronWolf> "Let's land in Stalingrad and have a picknic, dear!"
02:15 < EricD> Well
02:15 <+IronWolf> YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE DOING IT
02:15 <+Lambo> http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/17/sco_ibm_lawsuit_resumes/
02:15 < EricD> I like how it handles
02:15 <+SleepIsEasy> Thanatos: When I report things, they occasionally disappear, but I don't see NHO getting infractions =(
02:15 < EricD> I like it's turning and dogfighting ability
02:15 <+IronWolf> But EricD, if it was a woman
02:15 <+IronWolf> wouldn't you like to
02:15 <+Falchion> My god, this guy really IS worse than Aaron Fox.
02:15 <+SleepIsEasy> And it's fucking always NHO
02:15 < EricD> I don't particularly like the firepower
02:15 <+SleepIsEasy> ALWAYS
02:16 <+IronWolf> find out how it turns if you KNOW WHAT I MEAN
02:16 <+Thanatos> Oh hey, they have the Q5 Airacobra
02:16 <+Thanatos> HERO OF THE SOVIET UNION
02:16 <+Lambo> oh!
02:16 <+Lambo> we saw a PBY today
02:16 <+Lambo> IronWolf and I
02:16 <+IronWolf> Best part
02:16 <+Lambo> the pilot was tanker4444
02:16 <+Thanatos> It wasn't me :p
02:16 <+IronWolf> Yeah
02:16 <+IronWolf> Damn it. >:(
02:17 < |Minow|> did you gloriously murderize it?
02:17 <+IronWolf> I bet Thanatos
02:17 <+Lambo> erlier today I ran into Exposure in a match
02:17 <+IronWolf> has a funny pun name on War Thunder
02:17 <+IronWolf> That or it's just Thanatos
02:17 <+Lambo> and found him in his beaufighter
02:17 <+Lambo> I hate him
02:18 <+Lambo> next time i run into Exposure in a match
02:18 <+Lambo> and I have my P39
02:18 <+Lambo> he's gonna fucking pay.
02:18 < |Minow|> lol
02:18 < |Minow|> did he give you a 4x20 spanking?
02:18 <+Lambo> his gunners did
02:18 <+IronWolf> We should make our own squadron
02:18 <+IronWolf> ShadowSB
02:18 <+Thanatos> I like how I was reading up on the Airacobra
02:18 <+Thanatos> And the soviets fucking loved it
02:18 <+IronWolf> and hunt them down
02:18 <+Lambo> IronWolf: rofl
02:18 <+Thanatos> And half their top ten pilots
02:19 < I00thlurker> Aircobra pilots
02:19 < |Minow|> did you read teh thing where teh Soviet pilot talked about Fw 190 pilots loving head-ons?
02:19 <+Thanatos> Got the majority of their kills in the Airacobra
02:19 <+Thanatos> You already told me that :p
02:19 < EricD> I hate people who do head ons
02:19 < |Minow|> awww :-(
02:19 <+Lambo> I play chicken
02:19 <+Lambo> in headons
02:19 < |Minow|> well I'll tell everyone else!
02:19 <+Thanatos> Like
02:19 <+Thanatos> The United States
02:19 <+Lambo> and generally jink at the last moment
02:19 <+Thanatos> Accidently built
02:19 <+Thanatos> A soviet fighter pilots dream aircraft
02:19 <+SleepIsEasy> Lambo: I don't jink. :D
02:19 < |Minow|> Fw 190 pilots liked head-on passes, because their radial engines took damage really well and protected the pilot
02:20 <+Thanatos> "Is armored to shit and strong like bear"
02:20 < |Minow|> then they ran into Airacobras, and found head-on passes not so nice
02:20 < |Minow|> because no radial engine would stop a 37mm shell >:- D
02:20 <+Lambo> lol
02:20 <+Thanatos> "THIRTY SEVEN MILLIMETER SMASH FASCISTS"
02:20 < EricD> Soviet planes in WT are built of fucking mithril or something
02:20 <+Lambo> soviet biplanes
02:20 < |Minow|> duralumin!
02:20 <+Lambo> are a bitch
02:20 <+Lambo> they also have too many guns
02:20 <+Thanatos> That's actually part of their general design philosophy
02:20 <+Thanatos> IRL
02:21  * Falchion rubs his face with a cheese grater
02:21 <+Thanatos> Hence their love of the airacobra
02:21 <+Lambo> still
02:21 <+Thanatos> Which was armored to hell and back
02:21 <+Lambo> who wants to help me stuff a bushmaster into my P39?
02:21 <+Falchion> Using a .50-caliber as a coaxial for a serious setting...
02:21 < EricD> All the normal planes seem to be built of normal metals
02:21 < EricD> Except that Soviets are made of mithril
02:22 < EricD> And British are apparently made of balsa wood given my luck
02:22 <+Lambo> American planes are better!
02:22 <+Lambo> AMERICA
02:22 <+Lambo> FUCK YEAH
02:22 <+RangerKarl> [10:18] <+IronWolf> We should make our own squadron
02:22 <+RangerKarl> [10:18] <+IronWolf> ShadowSB
02:22 <+RangerKarl> I'm up for it
02:22 <+IronWolf> AIRACOBRA
02:22 <+IronWolf> WILDCATS
02:22 <+RangerKarl> MURICA
02:22 <+Lambo> Corsairs!
02:22  * IronWolf cries a single tear of liberty
02:22  * RangerKarl waves a huge fucking flag
02:22 <+Lambo> the gull wing murderer
02:22 <+Lambo> IronWolf, arne't you canadian?
02:22 <+RangerKarl> corsairs are dicks tho
02:22 < EricD> I have decent luck against American planes actually
02:22 <+RangerKarl> navy agreed, don't talk to me about it
02:22 <+IronWolf> I can enjoy American planes!
02:23 <+RangerKarl> [10:22] <EricD> I have decent luck against American planes actually
02:23 <+Lambo> IronWolf: well you live in America's hat!
02:23 <+Thanatos> [19:21] <EricD> And British are apparently made of balsa wood given my luck
02:23 <+RangerKarl> the nature of arcade puts them at disadvantage
02:23 <+Thanatos> Often literally
02:23 < I00thlurker> [22:20]	|Minow|	because no radial engine would stop a 37mm shell >:- D
02:23 <+RangerKarl> everyone keeps so much energy 
02:23 <+IronWolf> I'm not sure I'll enjoy the Corsair as much as the T7 Wildcat though
02:23 < I00thlurker> too bad there's only like, sixty rounds of it
02:23 <+IronWolf> because I'm not a BnZer
02:23 < I00thlurker> :(
02:23 <+RangerKarl> t7 wildcat is legit fun
02:23 <+IronWolf> my aim sucks too much
02:23 < |Minow|> the corsair is awfully meh IMO
02:23 <+Lambo> I really want a P47
02:23 < |Minow|> the first one doesn't even get any nice bomb/rocket loadouts
02:23 <+Lambo> and the P51 :(
02:23 <+IronWolf> Plus I like my tubby xCat planes.
02:24 <+RangerKarl> I have a P-47
02:24 <+RangerKarl> I never use it
02:24 <+RangerKarl> because repair bills lel
02:24 <+Lambo> can I have it?
02:24 < |Minow|> the later ones exist in a realm of cannon-armed planes
02:24 <+IronWolf> they are, dare I say, "Cute"
02:24 <+RangerKarl> no
02:24 <+Lambo> :(
02:24 < |Minow|> RangerKarl: they nerfed the repair bill already actually
02:24 <+RangerKarl> but once you get one we can squad up
02:24 <+RangerKarl> they did?
02:24 <+RangerKarl> oh I'd better check
02:24 <+Lambo> when will the SkyRaider come to WT?
02:24 <+IronWolf> I had to drop my HellKitty for another Airacobra though
02:24 <+IronWolf> sorry HellKitty but you just don't have the POOMF
02:25 <+RangerKarl> I dunno man
02:25 <+Thanatos> Also, I love the story of the Swede taking on those Zeros in a Dauntless
02:25 <+RangerKarl> 6000 buck repair bill is pretty hefty
02:25 <+Thanatos> And they were like
02:25 < |Minow|> and it still pretty much HAS to be on the list for a futher nerfing in the next economy update
02:25 <+Thanatos> "Son, you're a fighter pilot now"
02:25 < |Minow|> because ther'es nothing about the P-47's performance that deserves a repair bill like that
02:25 <+RangerKarl> yep
02:25 < I00thlurker> You know it's kind of weird to me that the Murica has most of the aircobras despite the soviets doing the most with them :p
02:25 <+RangerKarl> it can't climb for jack with the current flight model
02:25 <+IronWolf> Thanatos: Isn't that the one where he chops off a Zero wing with is own?
02:25 <+RangerKarl> compared to contemporary fw
02:25 <+IronWolf> *his
02:25 <+RangerKarl> s
02:26 < |Minow|> sure it should have astounding performance at ultra-high altitude
02:26 < |Minow|> except of course nboody ever actually fights up that high!
02:26 < |Minow|> ooooh, almost 700 kph at 8 km up!!! useless! :-P
02:26 < EricD> For those of you who play War Thunder, what has your best match been so far?
02:26 <+RRoan> just watched robocop for the first time
02:26 <+RRoan> (with dad for father's day)
02:26 < |Minow|> my best match ever was 16 kills
02:26 <+Thanatos> Yeah Ironwolf
02:26 <+Thanatos> After it rammed him
02:26 <+Thanatos> In desperation
02:26 <+IronWolf> Lol
02:27 <+IronWolf> Welcome to War Thunder
02:27 <+IronWolf> Man I wish i could get 16 kills
02:27 <+Lambo> EricD: http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/war-thunder-anyone-else-playing.247529/page-58#post-11070500
02:27 <+IronWolf> I think the best I ever had was 8
02:27 < |Minow|> also, since we're talking Airacobras, here's my favorite trick-shot of today: http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/7614/oxes.jpg
02:27 <+IronWolf> I get closer to four
02:27 <+ariqz> |Minow|: does mellian have a chance in the military?

02:41 < EricD> But the Spitfires piddly .303s don't do that all that well
02:41 <+RangerKarl> if your plane is critically damaged during the landing, well
02:41 <+RangerKarl> it counts
02:41 < EricD> So I end up chasing
02:41 < EricD> Now the Spitfire can chase just fine
02:42 < Admiral_Skippy> |Minow|: Fine, though I kinda went to sleep at two in the afternoon so i'd mostly sobered up while conscious

03:20 < Laird> lol I remember that image.
03:22 < mellian> obviously failed at deleting all evidence of it thanks to some douches
03:22 < Laird> once it's on the seen on the internet, you'll never get them all.
03:22 < Laird> Eer once it is see on the interbuttz
03:22 <+IronWolf> Indeed.

03:23 < mellian> no shit
03:24 < Laird> Wasn't that the image the sparked the whole "is mellian a man/woman?" etc...
03:24 <@Grin_Reaper> Laird
03:24 < Laird> I am not starting that debate
03:24 < Laird> just saying.
03:24 <@Grin_Reaper> and I'm just saying drop it
03:25 <+Falchion> And I'm saying HOLY SHIT, THE LECLERC HAS A COOL-LOOKING TURRET.
03:25 <+IronWolf> :D
03:25 <+IronWolf> that's the French MBT right?
03:25 <+Falchion> Yep.
03:25 <+IronWolf> Which had, IIRC
03:25 < Laird> France had tanks?
03:25 <+IronWolf> planned autoloader feature
03:25  * mellian has fond memories of sniping Laird from across blood gulch
03:25 <+IronWolf> for 140mm shells. :v
03:26 < Laird> If halo PC hadn't fallen into my lap then I know I wouldn't be working where I am now.
03:26 <+IronWolf> How so?
03:26 < I00thlurker> I didn't know they were planning on upgunning the leclerc
03:26 < I00thlurker> to 140mm
03:27 < Laird> @ironwolf I had shunned my gaming past to be a cool kid to ditch nerdly stuff.
03:27 <+IronWolf> It's either the leclerc or another tank (how specific)
03:27 < Laird> Halo PC in 2002 changed my perception on gaming was "cool" and if that hadn't happened I would have likely continued down the path of working at the airport for UPS.
03:28 <+SleepIsEasy> What exactly is it you DO for EA anyway?
03:28 < I00thlurker> @ Ironwolf
03:28 < Laird> instead of university>IT>Game dev.
03:28 < mellian> It was the first time playing Halo ever, and last since too i think
03:28 < I00thlurker> are you sure you're not thinking of one of the AMX series?
03:28 < mellian> after trying out the single missions, after Laird banned me from the server, lol
03:28 <+IronWolf> I might be!
03:28 < Laird> QA lead.
03:28 <+IronWolf> I know it was a tank with an autoloader
03:28 <+SleepIsEasy> Soooooo
03:28 <+IronWolf> I might be remembering a forum post
03:28 <+SleepIsEasy> Can I blame DA2 on you? <.<

03:30 <+IronWolf> last sentence of layout
03:30 < Laird> Now that I have a AAA game, and smaller title under my belt I can move on up.
03:31 < I00thlurker> ahah
03:31 < mellian> me too! But not as popular of a mmo though
03:31 < Laird> Go to ubisoft.
03:31 < mellian> been trying
03:32 < Laird> I could recommend you mellian, but I don't know you beyond SB.
03:32 < mellian> no love or in big search for QA at present
03:32 < mellian> indeed
03:32 < mellian> not in big search*

03:33 < mellian> I know been applying for the Anti-Piracy thing, and anything I believe i qualify. Same with WB, but their offices is full and waiting on their new floors to be ready last i check
03:34 < Laird> What about Bioware?
03:34 < mellian> i should just suck up the minimum wage and accepted the min wage EA Mobible tester
03:34 < Laird> Volt?
03:34 < mellian> probably gone up one or two steps since.
03:34 < mellian> Volt not responding to me
03:35 < Laird> really?
03:35 < Laird> Volt is the only way you can test.
03:35 < Laird> its the company we use.
03:35 < Laird> for contract labour
03:35 < Laird> What is min wage in que?
03:35 < Laird> Out here volt is contracted to pay at least $5 above min wage for testers.

03:36 < mellian> wait, I think i am confusing with vmc consulting
03:36 <+IronWolf> want to splitsies on this
03:36 < mellian> 9, 85 last year, gone up to 10.15 in jan or feb
03:36 < Laird> at my current salary, all my stock options and if I sold everything I own....

03:37 < Laird> oh and if I didn't eat either
03:37 <+IronWolf> "two-lane bowling alley"
03:37 <+IronWolf> who the fuck even has that in their home
03:37 < mellian> If it was not for roller derby, the guy that interviewed  me at EA was considering giving me QA lead or assisting lead during evening/night shifts
03:38 < Laird> it's own elevator too.
03:38 < Laird> Contractor or not?
03:38 <+SleepIsEasy> "At $29.9 million, this eight-bedroom fortress of luxury near the University of British Columbia â close to the water, away from the frat houses â has remained unsold since it was first listed in April."
03:39 < mellian> was amusing, one of first to call for interview after aptitude testing (bloody easy), and last to leave. 
03:39 <+SleepIsEasy> I guess there aren't many people out there looking to drop thirty million bucks on a house? I mean, presumably, they've already bought their thirty million dollar houses. 
03:39 <+SleepIsEasy> There can't be that many new buys
03:39 <+SleepIsEasy> *buyers
03:39 < Laird> There are.
03:39 <+IronWolf> Indeed, SleepIsEasy 
03:39 < Laird> lots of people from asia buy up all that stuff.
03:39 <+IronWolf> Man I wouldn't even want to live in that house
03:39 < mellian> I did not take the offer thinking I was get better last september, not regret it...well, except for being called back to Funcom for several more months befor e finally perma layoff
03:39 <+IronWolf> just walk though it
03:39 <+IronWolf> and then scan it
03:40 <+IronWolf> turn it into a video game environment
03:40 < Laird> If I was going to buy a million dollar home I'd buy the team canada mens hockey suite in olympic village.
03:40 <+IronWolf> and constantly fight virtual assassins in it. :v
03:40 < |Minow|> man I was going to bitch about matchmaking constantly putting me into high-level matches no matter what I flew
03:41 < |Minow|> then I shot down 4 P-40s in a row with my TYPHOOOON, so I can't really complain >.>
03:41 < Laird> Ya contractors get the shatf, the only way to get in FTE from contracting is to get to know your FTE boss.
03:41 < Laird> if he/she smokes and you don't.
03:41 < FalseProphet> |Minow|,  I shot down a Chiaka with a Bf-110
03:41 < FalseProphet> or whatever it is
03:41 < FalseProphet> yea Bf-110

04:02 <+Lambo> he used mIRC Stats

04:02 <+ariqz> log parsers are a dime a dozen
04:02 <@Lord_Squishy> Hmm
04:02 <+ariqz> really? Isil`Zha said he wrote his I thought 
04:02 <+Lambo> no
04:03 <+Lambo> he modified the parser for his logs
04:03 <+ariqz> ah
04:03 <+Isil`Zha> nono
04:03 <+Isil`Zha> I didn't have compelte logs
04:03 <+Isil`Zha> got them from squishy
04:03 <+Isil`Zha> and his were in HTML

04:06 <+IronWolf> :(
04:06 <+ariqz> for private chats
04:07 <+Lambo> ariqz: just encrypt DCC
04:07 <+Lambo> that's not hard
04:07 <+Lambo> since DCC /has not standard/
04:07 <+SleepIsEasy> t seems that SleepIsEasy's shift-key is hanging: 22.2% of the time he/she wrote UPPERCASE.
04:07 <+SleepIsEasy> For example, like this:
04:07 <+SleepIsEasy>      <SleepIsEasy> PEROGIE TIME

04:09 <+Lambo> probably not
04:09 <+SleepIsEasy> http://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/laser-bees/
04:09 <+Lambo> it's just client to client
04:09 <+Lambo> it doesn't use a server
04:09 <+ariqz> Lambo: another problem with DCC Is a lot of firewall stuff blocks it
04:09 <+Lambo> at all
04:09 <+Lambo> yeah
04:09 <+Lambo> the person that initializes the chat
04:09 <+Lambo> is the host
04:09 < FalseProphet> yea
04:09 <+Lambo> and the target has to connect to you
04:09 <@Lord_Squishy> Oh man |Minow|, I remember Crimson Skiese
04:09 <@Lord_Squishy> I loved that game
04:09 <+Lambo> it's very p2p
04:10 < FalseProphet> so German planes have gum and duct tape hlding their tail controls together
04:10 <+Lambo> Lord_Squishy, I have both games lol
04:10  * TM_Work grumbles
04:10 <+TM_Work> why can't they make a new Crimson Skies
04:10 <+TM_Work> imagine how pretty it could be. :(
04:10 <+Isil`Zha> Crimson Skies was fun
04:10 <+ariqz> I was looking into that, there are actually two versions for more compatibility, but it's still a mess. DCC probably won't work for 3/4 of the people here currently 
04:11 <+TM_Work> basically what you'd want to make is some sort of plugin that essentially uses IRC as the transport layer
04:11 <+ariqz> anyway, the encryption can be done with multiple packets like Lord_Squishy's OTR
04:11 <+ariqz> but
04:12 <+ariqz> the standard for any initiation doesn't exist. It has potential
04:12 <+TM_Work> seems like it'd be easier to do something like set up your own xmmp server and use that via secured connections
04:12 <+ariqz> it's not going to be easily referenced in a mIRC script though
04:13 <+TM_Work> whoops, xmpp
04:13 <+IronWolf> 'IronWolf's faithful follower, Thanatos, didn't speak so much: 1242 words."
04:13 <+IronWolf> I think you may
04:13 <+IronWolf> have the relationship a little wrong there, IRC stats
04:13 <+TM_Work> hell, I know there are quite a few EVE corps that use Jabber over IRC precisely for that reason
04:13 <+ariqz> I would just use RSA if I did it, but RSA handshake and then AES each new message makes a lot of sense 
04:13 <+ariqz> anyway
04:14 <+ariqz> OTR is a good place to start
04:14 <+TM_Work> pretty sure that what you want is basically Jabber
04:14 <+ariqz> it's a small library 
04:15 <+ariqz> what does Jabber use? 
04:15 <+TM_Work> hmmmmmm, and I may have water damaged my phone last night.
04:15 <+TM_Work> the screen keeps turning itself on and off all the time. :/
04:15 <+TM_Work> otherwise it's fine
04:15 <+ariqz> I could easily just make a fast implementation for one client
04:15 <+ariqz> but that's silly
04:15 <+ariqz> shor sighted
04:15 <+TM_Work> ariqz, Jabber is essentially an IM protocol
04:16 <+TM_Work> but it has stuff like TLS support baked right into the core
04:16 <+ariqz> it needs to be cross client, automatic, simple but clever
04:16 <+TM_Work> so if you turn it on basically everything is encrypted
04:16 <+ariqz> no, just private messages
04:17 <+ariqz> there needs to be a test for compatibility... like a dcc ?OTR?, perhaps. 
04:17 <+ariqz> but all automated
04:17 < DogBoy> what is love

04:38 <+Thanatos> Also really fast, I found that eyewitness to history book
04:38 <+Thanatos> And it was an SS division that had the account of like
04:38 <+Thanatos> They being all ballsy and badass and "Oh boy now that there is an invasion I can't wait"
04:39 <+Thanatos> "GRRR, GET SOME"
04:39 <+Thanatos> And then a bunch of P-47s strafe their convoy and destroy their shit
04:39 <+Thanatos> As they all flee
04:39 < Ford_Dylandy> Hey Minow
04:40 <+Thanatos> And then talks about how they spend the rest of the campaign crawling along, absolutely fucking terrified :p
04:40 < Ford_Dylandy> what was the name of that blog that called out MRAs all the time

04:40 <+Thanatos> Manboobz
04:40 <+Thanatos> Also it has a story of some british dudes with poor social skills capturing a german pilot
04:41 <+Thanatos> And accidently giving the impression they were going to execute him
04:41 <+Thanatos> As they make him have a cigarette and then accidently all step away from him in a field by a ditch :V

04:41 <+TM_Work> ;) :p

05:01 <+TM_Work> the core thing I want that none seem to offer is the ability to merge different logs together into one

05:16 < EricD> Falchion: What design feature aren't you satisfied with?

05:17 < EricD> What's wrong with it?
05:17 <+Falchion> The Daft Punkness of it.
05:17 <+Falchion> Feels overdone.
05:17 <+Falchion> Also, poor cheekweld.
05:17 < EricD> Maybe add more helmet-like features to the top and sides

07:10 <+Miura> oh?
07:10 <+Miura> how was it 
07:11 <+RangerKarl> kinda long
07:11 <+RangerKarl> and yet some scenes were strangely unsatisfying
07:11 <+RangerKarl> I like how clark technically ends up being jimmy olsen
07:11 <+RangerKarl> and I am disappointed
07:11 <+RangerKarl> that Martha wasn't the one who tailored his costume

07:14 < Skyllian_Blitz> now to get some posts in so no-one reads the OP and just starts blathering
07:14 <+IronWolf> I answered honestly
07:14 <@|Minow|> so I'm trying to watch ramjb's War Thunder videos
07:14 <@|Minow|> and GOD, can this dude ever get to the point!?
07:15 <@|Minow|> 25 minutes just to say "I think the Lavochkins have broken flight models"
07:16 <+RangerKarl> it's really tough to muddle through that accent
07:16 <+RangerKarl> makes me want to punch something
07:17 <+RangerKarl> jingles is also annoying because he makes you want to sleep
07:17 <@|Minow|> jingles also has some terrible ideas about game etiquette as well :-P
07:17 <+RangerKarl> such as?
07:18 <+RangerKarl> honestly don't remember any of his heuristics
07:18 <@|Minow|> like the one video where he bitches about someone in an SBD continuing his bombing run and ramming a ship afterwards instead of fighting it out
07:18 <@|Minow|> yes, a dive bomber should.... try to dogfight with two planes on him, when he's already been hit!?
07:19 <@|Minow|> or his endless complaining about ramming by enemies
07:19 <+RangerKarl> yeah fuck that
07:20 <@|Minow|> man, if my plane is going down, of COURSE I'm going to try and ram someone!

07:33 <+RangerKarl> so manley
07:33 < ariqz> I'm coming for you walper >:(
07:34 < ariqz> it's not that impressive, RangerKarl. It's pretty average for a weight lifter, but II hadn't touched weights in forever. I've just been running

07:38 < EricD> I don't lift any weights

07:44 < EricD> I can do 40 or 50 at a time generally

07:44 < I00thlurker> Jingles' voice is amazing
07:44 < I00thlurker> :p
07:48 < EricD> I never said I was tremendously strong, but I'd like to think I'm in reasonable shape
07:50 < ariqz> I'm in terrible shape, but that will still put me at the top of this channel likely

07:51 < ariqz> oh, Apocal... I don't know if he's still in great shape from the military or not
07:52 < ariqz> I want to be all cut and shit. It's on my bucket list to have a 6 pack
07:52 < ariqz> but thus far I'm not getting anywhere
07:53 < ariqz> the problem isn't really my state of mind ): It's my body. If I push it too hard, I get sick
07:54 < ariqz> I dunno where all the extra skin is going to go when I lose the fat to have a 6 pack either :P
07:55 <@|Minow|> droops and sags
07:56 < ariqz> maybe I'll have to get a tummy tuck
07:56 < I00thlurker> how vain :p
07:57 < ariqz> pfft, if I win the lottery, I'll get a nose job, hair transplant and every penis stretcher known to man

08:01 < ariqz> it's a little bit ironic that a guy has to choose between hair and penis size.

08:10 < ariqz> I don't know what's going on, but different people are on the relation map, and the ones that are the same are connected much differently 
08:10 < ariqz> I just looked at one a few hours ago
08:10 < ariqz> that was totally different 
08:11 < ariqz> LI and I were strongly connected, but I was also connected to MInow, ondine, dogboy and Merino
08:11 < ariqz> strongly cnnected and important, even
08:12 < ariqz> now I'm connected to SuperSonicSound? I barely talk to him
08:12 < ariqz> it's just not right
08:12 < ariqz> if it's new, why the hell isn't mellain on there? I've been riding her up and down the channel
08:12 < ariqz> I am disappoint 
08:13 <+Miura> well the more short-term one
08:13 <+Miura> was only a few hours
08:13 <+Miura> which rather explains it, doesn't it
08:13 < ariqz> that doesn't explain it either
08:14 < ariqz> people I hadn't talked to in days were on my relation map
08:17 < ariqz> whatever, it's poorly implemented if relationship strength and importance is so time critical. A true test of strength would be endurance
08:18 < ariqz> the algorithm impressed me for a short time, only for me to find out it's not what I thought it was ):
08:18 < ariqz> that or someone used crappy logs.
08:18 < ariqz> oh

08:29 <+Miura> what a bad trouble

08:29 <+IronWolf> Seriously though
08:29 <+IronWolf> his tone reminds me of The German
08:30 <+Miura> Ze German
08:30 < ariqz> So I can't interact with Mellain without being a giant ass, but I don't understand him/her. Why are they always so violent? My best theory is that makes them feel powerful on the internets, but surely it just gets them mocked everywhere?
08:31 < ariqz> she's probably killed me like 300 times by now
08:31 < ariqz> does she act that way on the forum too?
08:32 <+IronWolf> It's probably because you are dedicated to rustling her jimmies.
08:32 <+Miura> mellian is great
08:33 < ariqz> if I try to be sincere with her, she reacts in a way that's just asking for me to get her panties in a bunch, so I do
08:33 <+Miura> she seems pretty nice and normal to me
08:33 < ariqz> pretty much the only way for me to not pick on her is for me to not talk at all
08:33 <+Miura> maybe you're just an ass
08:33 <+IronWolf> You must attempt to practice restraint. Step one: refer to her as a her.
08:34 < ariqz> normal? I got cut up into body parts today a solid 5 times :P
08:34 <+Miura> I thought mellian was OEM
08:34 < ariqz> OEM?
08:34 <+Miura> not transsexual
08:34 < ariqz> ah
08:34 <+IronWolf> Thus only reinforcing my point to stop referring to her as a "him/her". Girls don't like that!
08:35 < ariqz> I don't really know, but I know more than she admits, and she says I just make it up or someone was pretending 
08:35 <+Miura> yes

10:03 < Twisted_Mentat> _folti_, yup, one of my aunts just had a mastecomy
10:03 < I00thlurker> quite a few ways to go, cancer is one of the worst. :(
10:03 < Twisted_Mentat> utemia, good. :)
10:03 < Twisted_Mentat> now you have to go climb that little hill outside your town. :p
10:03 < utemia> :)
10:03 <+_folti_> Twisted_Mentat: my  father had 2 different kinds of cancer. he died
10:03 < utemia> maybe in 2 weeks
10:04 < Twisted_Mentat> it's a very nice hill, has a lovely viewing platform on top
10:04 < Twisted_Mentat> met an elderly german couple who knew no english when I was there
10:04 < utemia> you're not really supposed to rest all that much
10:04 < Twisted_Mentat> it was fun me trying to remember how to say I was from NZ and on holiday. :p
10:04 < Twisted_Mentat> _folti_, stink. :(
10:04 < ariqs> utemia: ofc I was joking around. The idea of growing deformed stuff in your ovaries do squick me, but my reaction was to mock myself. 
10:04 < utemia> which is partly because they want to kick out patients earlier
10:04 < utemia> I know ariqs
10:04 < Twisted_Mentat> yup
10:05 < utemia> but also because it gets them fit alot sooner
10:05 < Twisted_Mentat> the quicker you can get people back into their normal routine the less stressful everything is. :)
10:05 < utemia> they want you to get up the same day
10:05 < Twisted_Mentat> and ah-hah, got the SbSpy running as a daemon
10:05 < Twisted_Mentat> ^_^
10:05 < utemia> that is, sit up
10:05 < utemia> stand up

10:06 < Twisted_Mentat> if you can move you can go home. :p
10:06 < utemia> yep, but im rather home than there
10:06 < utemia> my own bed
10:06 < Twisted_Mentat> yup
10:06 < Twisted_Mentat> much less stressful
10:06 < utemia> the thing was also that I had to go right away to the stupid hospital and didn't have anything with me
10:06 < Twisted_Mentat> mhm
10:06 < utemia> i didn't even have my phone
10:06 < Twisted_Mentat> this is why you need a kindle and a smartphone
10:07 < utemia> lol
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> on you at all times
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> maybe even a tablet
10:07 < utemia> they have phones there
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> just in case. ;)
10:07 < utemia> no clothes was worse
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> hmmmm, true

10:07 < utemia> lol
10:07 < utemia> :/
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> that could get very annoying very quickly
10:07 < Twisted_Mentat> lol
10:08 < Twisted_Mentat> this is why I have flatmates
10:08 < utemia> ariqs would like them

10:08 < Twisted_Mentat> ask them politely to bring me some of my clothes
10:08 < Twisted_Mentat> oh utemia, we also have some irc stats going now. :p
10:09 < utemia> what kind of stats

10:09 <+_folti_> who talks to whom much.
10:09 <+_folti_> who talks much 
10:09 < Twisted_Mentat> and Lambo has some better ones
10:09 <+_folti_> and such :P
10:10 < utemia> curious
10:10 < ariqs> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1357110/stats/SB_AllTime/spacebattles_page_2.html
10:10 < ariqs> that's lambo's

10:12 < Twisted_Mentat> and that reminds me, need to set it up to run every now and then
10:12 <+_folti_> vicron :P
10:13 < ariqs> Lambo has you out classed, Twisted_Mentat
10:13 < Twisted_Mentat> Lambo got some much more indepth software and has a much bigger stash of logs
10:13 < Twisted_Mentat> :p
10:13 <+_folti_> Twisted_Mentat: btw, if you need, i can give you the logs since early march
10:14 < Twisted_Mentat> so I don't care if he has me 'outclassed' :p
10:14 <+_folti_> Twisted_Mentat: but they are in irssi's format and with Europe/Budapest TZ stamps
10:14 < Twisted_Mentat> _folti_, I'll keep that in mind. First I want to put together some way of merging different logs
10:14 <+_folti_> ok
10:17 < Twisted_Mentat> cause that would be neat. just being able to gather all these different logs and making an uberlog
10:17 < Twisted_Mentat> ^_^

10:34 < Skyllian_Blitz> they sell it for $70+ :v
10:36 <+Exposure> like, the really funny thing is that people are trying to rebut MJ on the basis that they can still buy games at retail
10:36 <+Exposure> except they seem to forgot the part where a lot of games are coming with Steamworks
10:36 < Ford_Dylandy> On the other hand, we can get full refunds at EB for games returned within a week
10:37 < bidoof> that's cheating
10:37 < Ford_Dylandy> Which, by the way, won't be possible with Xbox One games, making that console even less appealing to Australians :v

13:05 < HarryLeferts> You know, I got to love the current argument with Acts or Omissions I'm in.
13:07 < HarryLeferts> My side is that nuclear weapons are among the worst weapons that you can use in space because you need to get right up close, practically touching, in order to damage a true interstellar space ship
13:07 < HarryLeferts> His is that they're incredibly effective weapons in space.
13:08 < HarryLeferts> Especially if you get within a few hundred meters.
13:08 < HarryLeferts> He's basically making my argument for me while saying that I am completely wrong.
13:11 <+_folti_> of course you are wrong! You doesn't need to  get a few hunded meters close for them to be useful. You only need a few hundred feets ! ... :P
13:12 < HarryLeferts> Well, for example, a multi-megaton nuke detonates 100 meters from the hull
13:12 < mellian> hey Harry
13:12 < HarryLeferts> According to him, the nuke isn't touching the hull when it detonates

14:01 < HarryLeferts> According to him?
14:02 < HarryLeferts> That would be enough damage to destroy even a Star Trek ship

14:04 <+_folti_> that was the tng ship? or the one riker killed in one of the movies?
14:04 < mellian> Star Trek ships can take ridiculous amounts of damage
14:04 < mellian> shit, recent movie shown they can relatively stay intact despite crashing landing into a city :p
14:04 < HarryLeferts> No clue which one, he's just using the Enterprise D
14:04 < Thanatos> Also hilariously
14:04 < Thanatos> In CoH 2
14:05 < Thanatos> Some of your tankers are female
14:05 <+_folti_> mellian: that's no-trek, different universe
14:05 < mellian> Still star trek in general. 
14:05 < HarryLeferts> A 1 megaton nuke, detonated at 100 meters, is enough to completely wreck if not destroy it
14:05 < mellian> alternate timeline or no
14:05 <+Exposure> Thanatos: So I take it there's a bajillion "THIS IS INACCURATE" complaints on the forums? :P
14:05 < mellian> nukes barely scratch star trek ships
14:06 < mellian> it is why they stop using nukes and went for photon torpedoes
14:06 < mellian> antimatter
14:06 < mellian> and later quantum
14:06 < Thanatos> Dunno
14:07 < mellian> Shit, shuttles survive generally intact crashing such a way to embed themselves into the ground

14:08 <+WorkWolf> HarryLeferts	A 1 megaton nuke, detonated at 100 meters, is enough to completely wreck if not destroy it <-- people give later series a lot of flak for being inconsistent, but really, let's be honest about when it started. :v
14:08 < Thanatos> No
14:08 < Thanatos> I was looking at Dark Souls
14:09 <+Exposure> oooooooooh
14:09 <+Exposure> I think even I00thlurker is willing to admit you should use a controller for that. :P
14:09 < Thanatos> Also
14:09 < Thanatos> XCOM is better with a controller :p
14:09 < I00thlurker> Yeah, Dark Souls was "ported"
14:09 < I00thlurker> in the roughest possible sense
14:09 <+RangerKarl> I expect MGRR to be the same
14:10 < I00thlurker> not that I blame FROMsoft because they're a /tiny/ studio
14:10 < I00thlurker> and, well, in general
14:10 < Thanatos> Doesn't it also require pretty precise movement
14:10 < I00thlurker> controllers tend to be better for action games
14:10 < I00thlurker> yeah
14:10 < mellian> Wait, for several examples in star trek of ships crashing and surviving mostly intact. Case in point Voyager :p  Defiant in alternate timeline of this planet crashed with most of the crew surviving to colonize
14:10 < I00thlurker> I'm willing to say you should totally get a controller for action games
14:10 < I00thlurker> KB&M WORKS, don't get me wrong
14:10 < mellian> Ent-D saucer section
14:11 < I00thlurker> but controller is definitely better
14:11 < Thanatos> "Works" lol
14:11 <+Lambo> controllers are also the best for racing games

14:49 <+Lambo> single jet engine
14:49 <+RangerKarl> He-162?
14:49 <+Lambo> and had an insane gun
14:49 <+Lambo> I think so
14:49 <+RangerKarl> iirc that only had MG-FFs or 151s
14:49 <+RangerKarl> nothing too cuhrazee
14:50 <+RangerKarl> jerry jets have nutty firepower but their range is horrid
14:50 <+RangerKarl> literally have to fly up and blackjack bombers into submission
14:50 <+Lambo> RangerKarl: Guns: 2 Ã 20 mm MG 151/20 autocannons with 120 rpg (He 162 A-2) OR 2 Ã 30 mm MK 108 cannons with 50 rpg (He 162 A-0, A-1)
14:50 <+Lambo> the He162
14:50 <+Lambo> you were sayng?
14:50 <+Lambo> lol
14:50 <+RangerKarl> aw yeah
14:50 <+RangerKarl> the MK-108s
14:50 <+RangerKarl> those are scary
14:50 <+RangerKarl> if you can get them to connect anyway

14:50 <+RangerKarl> ballistic coeff of a brick
14:50 <+RangerKarl> velocity to match too
14:51 <+RangerKarl> no idea what the war thunder variant has

14:51 < I00thlurker> Russian heat HOT
14:51 < I00thlurker> to defeat Russian Winter
14:52 <+Lambo> it's hilarious that Me262s were downed by P51s and P47s 
14:52 <+Lambo> in real life
14:52 <+Lambo> lol
14:52 <+RangerKarl> it doesn't take all that much to kill them, once you have them in your sights, really
14:52 <+RangerKarl> like
14:52 <+RangerKarl> if you sneezed at one in il2
14:52 <+RangerKarl> their engine catches fire
14:52 <+Lambo> hehe
14:52 <+Lambo> so many times I was flying one
14:52 <+Lambo> and I jiggled the throttle a bit to harshly
14:52 <+Lambo> suddenly 
14:52 <+Lambo> fire
14:52 <+RangerKarl> oh yeah
14:52 <+Lambo> and I wasn't even shot at
14:53 <+RangerKarl> "what's that, speed control?"
14:53 <+Lambo> the YP-80 was better
14:53 <+RangerKarl> jerk the throttle too hard and the engines explode
14:53 <+RangerKarl> poof
14:53 <+Lambo> never fly the Me262 at 100%
14:53 <+RangerKarl> p-80
14:53 <+RangerKarl> too underpowered
14:53 <+Lambo> which would fuck over a lot of people in WT...
14:53 <+RangerKarl> kinda disappointed no meteors in IL2
14:53 <+RangerKarl> which is really weird
14:54 <+Lambo> IL2 has some of the "wtf was germany smoking" planes
14:54 <+Lambo> like the one with the Annular wing
14:54 <+RangerKarl> WT doesn't model engine temperature problems that well
14:54 <+Lambo> that was VTOL
14:54 <+RangerKarl> most it does is cut off WEP and maybe continue engine fires if they were started by API rounds
14:54 < I00thlurker> ...VTOL
14:54 <+Lambo> and had wire guided anti-bomber rockets
14:55 <+RangerKarl> lol
14:55 <+RangerKarl> I tried those
14:55 <+RangerKarl> really awkward to use
14:55 < I00thlurker> well presumably there was a gunner who guided those
14:55 <+RangerKarl> not on the Ta-183
14:55 < I00thlurker> who could devote all his attention to it,
14:55 < I00thlurker> right?
14:55 <+RangerKarl> all the workload was on the pilot
14:55 < I00thlurker> ...wow
14:55 <+Lambo> oh yeah!
14:55 <+Lambo> the Ta-183
14:55 <+Lambo> lol
14:56 <+RangerKarl> tho like you said lurker
14:56 <+RangerKarl> only practical test in real life with the X-4
14:56 <+RangerKarl> was conducted  from Ju-88s

14:56 < Falchion> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmbZPzLmVTY
14:56 <+Lambo> 4 Ã 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons

14:58 <+Lambo> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Wulf_Super_Lorin
14:58 < I00thlurker> but the reason I said that was because I immediately thought of this design someone made for their airforce in Nationstates
14:59 < I00thlurker> which, at one point, was extremely ghetto
14:59 <+RangerKarl> oh?
14:59 < I00thlurker> so they were like "Shit, we need a ground attack aircraft"
14:59 < I00thlurker> so they stuck to mig-21 fishbed chassis side by side
14:59 <+Lambo> ...
14:59 <+Lambo> i don't like where this is going
14:59 < I00thlurker> and the gunner controlled the tv-guided missiles
14:59 <+RangerKarl> damn
15:00 <+RangerKarl> I thought that kind of  aeroplane design died when the war ended
15:00 < I00thlurker> it was fucking hilarious 
15:00 <+RangerKarl> stapling two fighters together like that
15:00 <+RangerKarl> lol
15:00 <@Grin_Reaper> Hey, the F-82 worked pretty well
15:00 < I00thlurker> it was exactly like that design that stuck two P-51 bodies on one wing
15:00 <+RangerKarl> and that lineage ended right there
15:00 <+RangerKarl> twiiiiiiiiin mustang
15:00 < I00thlurker> except with fishbeds
15:00 < I00thlurker> in stead of mustangs
15:01 <+RangerKarl> bf-109z
15:01 <+RangerKarl> the Z stands for gattai
15:01 < I00thlurker> but like, I really liked it and remembered it forever after
15:01 <+Lambo> I'm glad Germany surrendered when it did
15:01 < I00thlurker> because it totally fit an airforce that had no fucking money
15:01 <+RangerKarl> now there's a fighter idea
15:01 <+RangerKarl> TWIN MUSTANG
15:01 <+RangerKarl> get on it gaijin
15:01 <+Lambo> because allied pilots running into some of these planes
15:01 <+Lambo> would be like "... what"
15:02 < I00thlurker> and were like "Well we need SOMETHING"
15:02 <+RangerKarl> I imagine adolf galland and the rest of the luftwaffe chaps throwing their hands up and shaking their heads half the war
15:02 < I00thlurker> which is a giant change from the usual RAH RAH MOST AMAZING FIGHTER TO EVER FLY
15:02 < I00thlurker> that fills nationstates
15:02 <+Lambo> i've seen people flying the plane that was recently added

16:03 <@Lord_Squishy> For a long time in England- some three to eight hundred years, give or take, depending on who you ask- the Church actually had courts of law and could dish out punishments, marriages, and the like.
16:03 <+chibispace> heh

18:22 <@Lord_Squishy> Is there more than one? I just thought- ah
18:22 <@|Minow|> I have a G4M1
18:22 <@Lord_Squishy> any good?
18:23 <@|Minow|> it's reasonably fast and maneuverable, rather meh bomb options though
18:23 <@|Minow|> also it has pretty much no protection whatsoever
18:23 <@Lord_Squishy> ahh
18:24 <@|Minow|> 12 x 50 kg, which is basically useless for anything other than fixed positions; 4 x 250 which is good for hitting tanks but isn't very many; 1 torpedo which sucks cause naval AAA is stupidly good, or 1 x 1,000 kg which is... sort of useless
18:24 <@|Minow|> I have got a fair number of tail-turrets kills with it though, which is always funny

20:22 <+Exposure> since apparently, Xbox Live bans can be accured for...a lot of things
20:22 <+SuperSonicSound> [21:21] <@Lord_Squishy> The EU cases around software do not prohibit software licensing
20:22 <+Exposure> compared to how VAC is generally just for cheating
20:22 <+SuperSonicSound> True.
20:22 <+Exposure> (and VAC bans don't make you lose access to your singleplayer content)
20:22 <+Lambo> unless you do something stupid
20:22 <@Lord_Squishy> They just only blur the line between actual licensing and selling
20:22 <+Lambo> like offer your software for piracy ;p
20:22 <@Lord_Squishy> Which really helps nobody
20:22 <+SuperSonicSound> It helps consumers
20:22 <@Lord_Squishy> No
20:22 <+Lambo> didn't the EU force Valve to have a used game store?
20:22 <@Lord_Squishy> It doesn't help consumers
20:22 <+SuperSonicSound> otherwise all the power resides with the seller
20:22 <+Lambo> or the ability to transfer games?
20:22 <@Lord_Squishy> For one thing, it's incredibly vague and obscure

20:25 <@Lord_Squishy> ...
20:25 <@Lord_Squishy> you don't write software a million times
20:25 <+SuperSonicSound> at the end of the day you have a million of each product
20:25 <+Lambo> software is written once

20:25 <+Lambo> not a reproduction
20:25 < SeaDart> Whatever makes you feel better ariqs 
20:26 <+DogBoy> Hey Lord_Squishy, how long until you can't sell moves or music anymore due to it be a licensed product?
20:26 <@Lord_Squishy> The difference is that with software, you are paying for the right to reproduce the object whereas with physical objects, you are generally paying for possession of an object
20:26 < SeaDart> You sad little man :(
20:26 <+DogBoy> resell*
20:26 <@Lord_Squishy> In fact, this need not be the case
20:26 <@Lord_Squishy> There are plenty of examples where it goes both ways
20:26 <+SuperSonicSound> I don't feel thats right and fair though.
20:26 <@Lord_Squishy> For example, books are physical objects.
20:26 <+SuperSonicSound> A person who buys a product
20:26 <+SuperSonicSound> should be allowed to sell it second hand
20:26 <+Lambo> namespace Program { public static class MyProgram { void Main() { Console.WriteLine("Hello world"); } }}
20:26 <+Lambo> I just distributed a program
20:26 <+SuperSonicSound> unless it's something that can only be used once due to physical limitiations such as food.
20:26 <+DogBoy> high blood pressure, osteoporosis, pain, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis.
20:26 <+Lambo> to everyone ehre.
20:26 < SeaDart> Hello World!
20:26 <+DogBoy> I don't have any of those
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: And nobody's stopping you from selling it second-hand, the question is, what can you sell?
20:27 <+SuperSonicSound> Lord squishy if you have a single user license thats non-transferable for games
20:27 <+Lambo> I sent it to the server, the server then copied it to a bunch of other servers which then sent their copy to you
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: That's not the same thing though
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> Licenses can't be sold
20:27 <+SuperSonicSound> then by definition you can no longer sell it second hand
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> They can only be assigned
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> A license is not a thing
20:27 <@Lord_Squishy> It is a right
20:27 <+SuperSonicSound> Yes thats the seller using a legal loop hole to deny the consumer the ability to sell what he has bought.

20:29 < SeaDart> Here comes the law train
20:29 < SeaDart> Choo choo

20:31 <@Lord_Squishy> Nobody with any actual understanding of these rights believes that you can go to a store, pick up a boxed copy of Starcraft, and buy the game
20:31 <+SuperSonicSound> And i'm saying the majority of people view the transaction occuring in a different way to how it's being legally defined
20:31 <@Lord_Squishy> No, they don't
20:31 < SeaDart> Well the BB thread has died
20:31 < SeaDart> Thankfully
20:31 <@Lord_Squishy> People aren't fucking nuts
20:31 <+SuperSonicSound> Yes they do squishy people believe they have the right to sell the fucking game in fully working format to anyone they like
20:31 <@Lord_Squishy> The majority of people view the transaction the right way, but they call it the wrong thing and then they get into discontinuities
20:31 <@Lord_Squishy> because what they call it is not what they think it is
20:31 <+SuperSonicSound> It's something that used to be no damn problem ten years ago
20:32 <@Lord_Squishy> No, it was a great problem ten years ago
20:32 <+DogBoy> I think that instead of focusing on licensing versus purchasing, we should instead be focusing on making it so that a company (ie. valve) can't take away a license for arbitrary reasons 
20:32 <@Lord_Squishy> In fact, it's been a problem since about 1662.
20:32 <+DogBoy> such as banning
20:32 <@|Minow|> what does Westphalia have to do with this, eh!?
20:32 <@Lord_Squishy> that was 1648, Minow
20:32 <+SuperSonicSound> Squishy... you aren't understanding the argument i'm making
20:33 <@Lord_Squishy> 1662 was the Licensing Act, followed in 1710 by the Statute of Anne
20:33 < zeit> he is super.
20:33 <+SuperSonicSound> Unless you are saying people have been trying to stop second hand sales since 1662
20:33 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: I understand the argument you're making, your argument is just dumb and stupid.
20:33 <+SuperSonicSound> which i suppose could be possible
20:33 < Emmjay_XII> hey you know what's amazing?
20:33 <@|Minow|> yeah yeah I know Lord_Squishy, that wasn't the point! ;-P
20:33 < Emmjay_XII> YUIOP
20:33 <+SuperSonicSound> Oh look squishy is being a rude twat
20:33 < SeaDart> Sadly, the indonesia vs australia thread hasn't
20:33 <+SuperSonicSound> le shock
20:33 < SeaDart> <Emmjay_XII>	 YUIOP
20:33 <+DogBoy> da fuck is YUIOP
20:33 < SeaDart> You don't say?
20:33 < SeaDart> He's a racist DogBoy  :(
20:33 <@Lord_Squishy> The whole point of copyright is to limit and restrict second-hand sales.
20:33 <+Apocal> [13:31:22] <+DogBoy> I think that instead of focusing on licensing versus purchasing, we should instead be focusing on making it so that a company (ie. valve) can't take away a license for arbitrary reasons  --- pffft fuck that
20:33 <@Lord_Squishy> That's why it exists.
20:34 < zeit> Not agreeing with you isnt the same as not undersanding your position.
20:34 <+SuperSonicSound> He's arguing against something different to what i'm saying though
20:34 <@Lord_Squishy> I'm saying you don't know what you're talking about
20:34 <+SuperSonicSound> I was under the impression copyright was to stop you making a copy of something
20:34 <+DogBoy> You want them to be able to take away a license for arbitrary reason Apocal?
20:34 < SeaDart> Here comes the law train
20:34 <+SuperSonicSound> not to sell something you already own
20:34 <+SuperSonicSound> like say a book
20:34 <@Lord_Squishy> ...
20:34  * Lord_Squishy sighs
20:34 <+Lambo>  <+DogBoy> such as banning  <-- your account would only be suspended for piracy, illegal activity, stealing someone's account etc
20:34 <@Lord_Squishy> Urgh
20:35 <+Apocal> Yes DogBoy
20:35 <+Lambo> DogBoy: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5406-WFZC-5519
20:35 <+Lambo> read
20:35 <+Lambo> those are not arbitrary
20:35 <@Lord_Squishy> You are confusing intellectual licenses and physical objects, SuperSonicSound. A book is just paper. Nobody is stopping you from reselling it. Similarly, nobody is stopping you from selling the little plastic disk that has your game on it.
20:35 <@Lord_Squishy> There was never any attempt to restrict the resale of those objects
20:35 < zeit> your not saying you have the right to sell a game when you buy it to anyone you choose?
20:35 <+DogBoy> Oh
20:35 <+DogBoy> ok, that's different
20:35 <@Lord_Squishy> Nobody actually cares about restricting the resale of physical objects which contain data
20:35 <+DogBoy> Though the banning part is mostly for Xbox one
20:36 <@Lord_Squishy> (well there are some exceptions, but they are not relevant here)
20:36 <+DogBoy> I heard not good things about Live and banning 
20:36 <+SuperSonicSound> but if that data is useless due to the nature of licensing the consumer has lost a right they should have.
20:36 <@Lord_Squishy> No
20:36 <@Lord_Squishy> They have not
20:36 <@Lord_Squishy> Because the license has always been a very separate legal object to the physical object
20:37 <+SuperSonicSound> Okay explain why there should be any difference between cd with music and cd with a computer game on it
20:37 < zeit> why should they have that right?
20:37 <+SuperSonicSound> either way the original company has had their sale.
20:37 < zeit> Sonic?
20:37 <@Lord_Squishy> There isn't, SuperSonicSound. The CD exists in exactly the same legal regime
20:37 <@Lord_Squishy> However, not all media is licensed the same. For example, video and audio are licensed for personal performance.
20:37 <@Lord_Squishy> You can't take a CD you buy at walmart and then play it for a concert
20:38 <@Lord_Squishy> Or use the music in a movie you produce
20:38 <+RRoan> man
20:38 <+SuperSonicSound> Hmm
20:38 <+RRoan> yuiop's reading comprehension is terrible
20:38 < zeit> hey rroan!
20:38 <+RRoan> even for spessbattles
20:38 <@Lord_Squishy> Similarly, if you purchase a piece of art, there are legal restrictions imposed on what you can do with it. For example, you cannot hang tinsel around an artistic display of papier machier swans that I create for you (real case)
20:38 < zeit> what did yuiop say?
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> [10:38] <+RRoan> even for spessbattles
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> This where he can't even read PR speak?
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> I think PS4 broke him
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> stupid rays
20:39 <+RRoan> mhm
20:39 <+SuperSonicSound> what?
20:39 <+Lambo> Emmjay_XII, when he was last here
20:39 <+Lambo> I think we broke him
20:39 < SeaDart> he's an 18 year old second/third generation Chinese living in the USA zeit 
20:39 < SeaDart> He isn't that smart
20:39 <+SuperSonicSound> [21:38] <@Lord_Squishy> Similarly, if you purchase a piece of art, there are legal restrictions imposed on what you can do with it. For example, you cannot hang tinsel around an artistic display of papier machier swans that I create for you (real case)
20:39 <@|Minow|> what is this case Lord_Squishy
20:39 <+SuperSonicSound> Seriously?
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> YUIOP linked an article about how 'EA didn't ask for DRM'
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> which was full of PR weasel speak
20:39 <@Lord_Squishy> Yes, it's the moral rights thing
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> about how they didn't lobby aggressively
20:39 < Emmjay_XII> or say that this DRM MUST be on the consoles
20:40 <@|Minow|> what if i set your papier mache swans on fire?
20:40 < Emmjay_XII> which is basically as much as saying 'we did a ton of lobbying but we were subtle about it'
20:40 < SeaDart> I did this personality test thing
20:40 < SeaDart> 'Fictional ISTJ's: Eeyore (Winnie the Pooh), Bruce Wayne (Batman), - See more at: http://www.personalitymax.com/free-personality-test/results#sthash.tQSlj9Gz.dpuf'
20:40 < SeaDart> I'M BATMAN
20:40 <@Lord_Squishy> |Minow|: Some artists have argued that their moral rights protects against that, too
20:40 <@|Minow|> ISTJ, ewwww
20:40 <+SuperSonicSound> Man law is such onesided bullshit :|
20:40 <@|Minow|> INTJ 4 lyfe
20:40 < SeaDart> Intuition?
20:40 <@Lord_Squishy> Oh shit and I just packed up my casebook with that case in it, let me see if I canf ind it...
20:40 < SeaDart> Thinking of your feet?
20:40 < SeaDart> I MUST FOLLOW THE PLAN
20:40 < ariqs> INTP like einstein here, yo
20:41 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: There's nothing one-sided about it
20:41 <+DogBoy> no SeaDart, you Eeyore
20:41 < SeaDart> I'm Batman
20:41 < SeaDart> Or Darth Vader
20:41  * RRoan usually gets INTJ
20:41 <@|Minow|> SeaDart as Eeyore is amusingly fititng
20:41  * |Minow| hi-fives RRoan
20:41 <+SuperSonicSound> Really Squishy, you don't think certain organisations aren't vastly more powerful in how they can dictate terms in contracts?
20:41 <+DogBoy> I think I get INTJ
20:41 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: Like what?
20:42 <+Flatline> No, Seadart. You're Rorschach. There's a difference. :p
20:42 <+Isil-Work> [13:39]	Emmjay_XII	YUIOP linked an article about how 'EA didn't ask for DRM' <---- I see he's still harping on about "IRC BANDWAGON CONSPIRACY"
20:42 < SeaDart> <@|Minow|>	 SeaDart as Eeyore is amusingly fititng
20:42 < SeaDart> :(
20:42 < zeit> irc bandwagon conspiracy?
20:42 <+RRoan> willing to bet that INTJ and similar are wildly overrepresented on sb
20:42 < zeit> What in the world?
20:42 <+RRoan> zeit
20:42 <+RRoan> you're a member of the SHADOW CABAL
20:42 < zeit> what roan?
20:42 <+SuperSonicSound> Employers for the most part in employment contracts. Anything corporation that sells things on a large scale. Software companies with licensing schemes for their software.
20:42 < zeit> yay!
20:43 <+SuperSonicSound> Consumer has little choice than to walk away
20:43 < SeaDart> Shadow Cabal?
20:43 < SeaDart> Sounds shady
20:43 <+SuperSonicSound> All of those things are massively one sided affairs
20:43 <+Isil-Work> Well, YUIOP is apparently butthurt about his short time he spent here being a doofus
20:43 < SeaDart> Isil-Work still?
20:43 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: What you are saying is that rich people have more money and influence than poor people
20:43 <@Lord_Squishy> This shocks you
20:43 < SeaDart> Can we invite him back here?
20:44 <+SuperSonicSound> [21:43] <@Lord_Squishy> This shocks you
20:44 <+DogBoy> huh
20:44 <+SuperSonicSound> Did i say i was shocked?
20:44 <+DogBoy> oddly enough
20:44 <+SuperSonicSound> I said it wasn't fair or right.

20:44 <@Lord_Squishy> SuperSonicSound: I don't know that there's anything per se unfair about it. Everyone is treated the same, which can be beneficial to people.
20:45 <@Lord_Squishy> Anyway, for those curious about the case I mentioned: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_v._The_Eaton_Centre_Ltd.
20:45 <@Lord_Squishy> It was ribbons, not tinsel, but the effect's the same
20:45 <@Lord_Squishy> (and they were geese, not swans. But I was close.)
20:46 <+Isil-Work> SeaDart: Not that I know of (or care about)
20:46 < SeaDart> ariqs, so did that hippie long-haired CS guy get back to you
20:46 < SeaDart> He was entertaining while he was here
20:46 <+Lambo> SeaDart: i enjoyed trolling YUOIP
20:46 < SeaDart> Seriously believed I was a Chinese person
20:46 <+RRoan> seadart: yup
20:47 <+RRoan> there are a few recent mentions in the e3 thread
20:47 < zeit> hey rroan.
20:47 < ariqs> SeaDart: yes, but he's not going to do my bidding
20:47 < zeit> You know about firearms?
20:47 <@Grin_Reaper> haha
20:47 <+RRoan> "THE IRC CHANNEL IS PRO-MICROSOFT" and the like
20:47 <+RRoan> a fair bit :p
20:47 <@Grin_Reaper> does she know about firearms
20:47 < zeit> What would it take for gyrojet ammonution to be pratical?
20:48 < zeit> it's for a sci-fi setting i'm working on.
20:48 < ariqs> I am going to have to do it myself
20:48 < ariqs> I tried TM, but honestly, I don't think he's smart enough anyway ):
20:48 < zeit> Kinetics are cooler then laser, especially when they explode.
20:48 <@Grin_Reaper> well, lousy quality control was one of the big issues RL gyrojets had
20:48 < ariqs> Lambo could do it, but I don't think I can talk him into it
20:49 < SeaDart> Of course he isn't ariqs, he's a hippy
20:49 < SeaDart> If I see him out and about i'll troll him for ya
20:49 <+Lambo> what, PRIVMSG encryption or DCC Chat encrpytion?
20:49 <+RRoan> IIRC, the two main problems are expense (much more complicated than a regular bullet) and the fact that they're weaker at close range than they are at long range
20:49 < ariqs> don't get your ass kicked out of college to troll someone, SeaDart
20:50 <@Grin_Reaper> IIRC the low-power at close range thing was exaggerated
20:50 < SeaDart> It's just college
20:50 < SeaDart> I always have the Navy to crawl back to!
20:50 < zeit> Ah all right.
20:50 < ariqs> Lambo: well thought out cross client standard 
20:50 <+Lambo> <+RRoan> "THE IRC CHANNEL IS PRO-MICROSOFT" and the like  <-- I am PRO MICROSOFT but I am ambivalent towards the X1 lol
20:50 <+Lambo> right, I have no time for a new standard to stuff ontop of IRC
20:50 < SeaDart> I must case YUIOP
20:50 < zeit> sci-fi manufactuing tech can take care of one, and I can have it so most combat takes place in extreme ranges due to powerful sensor tech.
20:50 < zeit> Thanks rroan.
20:51 -!- TM_Away is now known as TM_Work
20:51 <+RRoan> you could add a way to give it a boost out of the barrel
20:51 <+RRoan> but that would add recoil
20:51 < zeit> actually that's a good idea.
20:51 <+RRoan> see: wh40k bolters
20:51 < zeit> Ah.
20:52 < zeit> So it would probably be used similar toheavy anti-squad weaponery by normal people.
20:52 < zeit> Sounds bout right.
20:52 <+RRoan> depends
20:52 <@Grin_Reaper> Well not necessarily
20:52 < zeit> ?
20:52 <+TM_Work> morning folks
20:52 < SeaDart> Wait, like a SAW?
20:52 <+Lambo> good afternoon TM_Work

20:52 < SeaDart> Herro
20:52 <+TM_Work> woot! ^_^
20:52 < SeaDart> Oh god it's 5am
20:53 < zeit> anyway, thanks.
20:53 <+Lambo> this channel now has
20:53 <+Lambo> nightly stats
20:53 <+Lambo> weekly stats
20:53 <+Lambo> monthly stats
20:53 <+RRoan> the problem with doing that is that it reintroduces recoil, when a lack of recoil is one of the largest advantages of a gyrojet gun
20:53 <+Lambo> weekly stats from all of time
20:53 <+Lambo> I think we're good for stats
20:53 <+Lambo> lol
20:54 <+TM_Work> Lambo, like I mentioned yesterday my next aim is to put together some sort of log merger
20:54 <+TM_Work> :p
20:54 <@Grin_Reaper> Really, the only reason to do it would be if you were making them guided bullets of some sort
20:54 <+Lambo> lol
20:54 <+TM_Work> think how awesome that'd be
20:54 <+Lambo> TM_Work, one of my long term goals, searchable logs
20:54 <+Lambo> as in, written right to a DB
20:55 <+Lambo> using.. I dunno

21:41 < havocfett>  14:37	SuperSonicSound	Sothe  Moors and Castile in close proximity? <- In the same city, here. The setting's basically a fractured, swords-and-sorcery version of the west (Europe, Mid-East, Africa)
21:41 <+SuperSonicSound> Interesting.
21:42 < havocfett> Where cannons have just been invented
21:42 <+SuperSonicSound> are you planning to publish this or is it just for fun?
21:42 < havocfett> As for the piece itself? Less 'High Fantasy with Political Message' and more 'Conan the Barbarian With Less Racism', thematically.

23:00 <@Lord_Squishy> The ECJ ruling was terribly unclear on what it meant by "could not oppose"
23:01 <@Lord_Squishy> I mean the original case that it was dealing with, if memory served, involved physically selling and transferring disks, licenses, etc.
23:01 <@Lord_Squishy> But it was unclear on whether publishers actually had to DO anything about it
23:01 <@Lord_Squishy> AFAIK some German consumer ministry tried to get an answer but I don't know what happened with that
23:02 <@|Minow|> see Exterminatus, I keep on playing HB for a bit
23:02 <@Lord_Squishy> Also, software/licensing and perfect/good
23:02 <@|Minow|> but then my favorite planes have weird handling and I just know that I should be flying them with a joystick

00:06 <+RangerKarl> somehow
00:06 <+McPwned> do his punchs cause sonic booms ?
00:06 < Eating_Skippy> McPwned: at least a few, i think
00:06 < Eating_Skippy> apparently he only learns how to use his laser vision during the actual film
00:06 < Fivemarks> RK: I think that was because the Kryptonian got blindsided
00:06 < Fivemarks> What
00:06 < Fivemarks> I mean
00:06 < Fivemarks> He kinda does
00:06 <+McPwned> do his eye lasors ionzie teh atmosphere

00:07 <+RangerKarl> he doesn't use his heat vision much in combat because it disorients him 
00:07 < Fivemarks> Flight.
00:07 <+RangerKarl> they're a little bit consistent about that
00:07 < Fivemarks> And to be fair, he picks up flight pretty quickly

01:03 < AI_Beta> No, I don't have the pheromone therapy thing.
01:03 < Admiral_Skippy> well the tracker and the accutane is basically a cure as well
01:03 < Admiral_Skippy> one more easy to live with
01:04 <+Airawolfra> Wait, tracker?
01:04 <+Airawolfra> This is new.
01:04 <+Random832> so what's the ammonia thing?
01:04 < Admiral_Skippy> Airawolfra: i just fucking said that above!
01:04 < Admiral_Skippy> Airawolfra: you did a little pointy up arrow to signify that is was what they'd made!
01:05 <+Airawolfra> Oh, I read the accutabe
01:05 <+Airawolfra> *accutane
01:05 <+Airawolfra> and anyways she does carry a tracking device
01:05 <+Airawolfra> it's called her communicator. :P
01:05 < Admiral_Skippy> oh
01:05 < Admiral_Skippy> can that tell if she's using the pheremone though?
01:06 <+Miura> TOS communicators were the best
01:06 < Admiral_Skippy> and is the accutane like, actually being used?
01:06 <+Airawolfra> Presumably internal sensors/blood tests could handle that
01:06 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: Serious question this time, is the Klingon/Orion alliance still a thing in your game?
01:06 <+Miura> why is accutane good
01:06 <+Miura> I can't tell
01:06 <+Airawolfra> Like, let's not assume the Federation is using 1984 as a guidebook here folks
01:06 < AI_Beta> So, it's better than real life?
01:07 < Admiral_Skippy> so when you said you didn't want to use the treatment, did you mean the accutane, or something else?
01:07  * Admiral_Skippy dosen't even care anymore, but he is determined to uncover the truth
01:07 < Admiral_Skippy> sunk cost fallacy ahoy!
01:07 <+Airawolfra> Yes, unless it becomes inconvienient. However, note that not ALL Orions allied with the KDF -- certainly the Syndicate still opposes the KDF AND Starfleet.
01:07 <+Airawolfra> Admiral_Skippy: He's referring to a horomone suppression therapy.
01:07 < AI_Beta> ^That.
01:07 < Admiral_Skippy> Airawolfra: oh, right, cool
01:08 <+Miura> KDF?
01:08 < Admiral_Skippy> so it's kinda like if you could choose to take hayfever medication, or a steroid treatment that could have nasty sideeffects
01:08 <+Miura> what does that stand for
01:08 <+Airawolfra> |Minow|/Exposure/Lord_Squishy 
01:08 <+Airawolfra> War Thudner?
01:08 < AI_Beta> Klingon Defense Force or something.
01:08 <+Airawolfra> That.
01:08 < Admiral_Skippy> and you just decided to have your piriton and fuck it if you have to wipe your eyes a but
01:08 <+Miura> the klingons don't seem the sort to name their fleet a defense force
01:09 <+Airawolfra> It's canon. :P
01:09 < Admiral_Skippy> this should not have taken over a page to work out guys!
01:09 < Admiral_Skippy> how will you save the galaxy with this attuide
01:09 <+Miura> lol
01:09 < AI_Beta> Miura: People's REpublic of China.
01:09 <+Airawolfra> Although in DS9 It was Imperial Klingon Defense Force.
01:09 <+Miura> Admiral_Skippy: I was decisive
01:09 <+Miura> and sure of myd ecisions
01:09 <+Miura> as a captain should be
01:09 <+Miura> AI_Beta: but I don't see the klingons as trying to pretend their space navy isn't anything else

01:10 <+Miura> I am going to watch the klingon scene from TMP again
01:11 <+Miura> that is the best scene in all of Star Trek
01:11 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: Regarding Orions and the KDF, I figured that maybe the reason why Valara is willing to put up with being a second-class citizen in the UFP is because it'd be worse for her in the KDF.

01:11  * Admiral_Skippy wonders if distracting a caitian with tassles would be a hate crime.
01:11 -!- Sarpedon1_ is now known as Sarpedon1
01:11 <+Miura> according to the furry ironwolf likes to get his fluff from
01:11 <+Miura> caitians are easily distracted by flashing lights and dangling string and such
01:12 <+Miura> to the point that they can't stand at attention easily
01:12 <+Airawolfra> AI: Yes. It is more than possible that she'd be a slave in the KDF right now.
01:12 <+Airawolfra> Although i'd be careful with "second class citizen"
01:12 < AI_Beta> Her perspective.
01:12 <+Airawolfra> She probably gets a lot of mistrust but don't assume she has any of the Federation's services cut off to her.
01:12 < AI_Beta> Feel free to give her the sense of perspective of Captain Walker.
01:13 <+Airawolfra> Why is this ship full of Walkers?!
01:13 <+Airawolfra> But yeah AI
01:13 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: In other words, she's the angry bl^H^Hgreen chick.
01:13 <+Airawolfra> getting mistrust from your fellow Federation citizens
01:13 <+Miura> well AI
01:13 <+Miura> if you were to be a slave
01:13 <+Airawolfra> is better than sucking KDF dick
01:13 <+Miura> maybe I rescued you from that, for our crossover
01:13 <+Airawolfra> and I mean that in the most literal sense
01:13 < Admiral_Skippy> fucking hell, so much blood
01:14 < Admiral_Skippy> it was like half a cm of skin how can there be that much
01:14 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: I was about to make a joke about ridged for her pleasure.
01:14 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: haha
01:14 <+Airawolfra> Her /displeasure/ perhaps
01:14 <+Airawolfra> (Collarbone breaking is common, according to Worf.)
01:14 <+Miura> sexy
01:15 <+Miura> one thing TOS had that I don't think later STs do
01:15 <+Miura> is the sense of vastness and distance
01:15 <+Miura> I like that
01:15 < AI_Beta> Thanks to the Trek & the City twitter, I'm now thinking of an Orion woman grinding on a Klingon's forehead. :|
01:15 < Admiral_Skippy> Airawolfra: My worst snu-snu related insury was a five cm long wooden splinter in my thigh, and a sprained wrist
01:15 < Admiral_Skippy> Airawolfra: craftsmanship is dead : (
01:16 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: hahahahahaha
01:16 < Admiral_Skippy> the spinter wasnt's all the way in though!
01:16 < Admiral_Skippy> only like a little way
01:16 < Admiral_Skippy> too close to the femoral for comfort though

01:17 < Erik_Tuber> With a saw
01:17 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: nope, broke a cheap wooden double bed
01:17 < Admiral_Skippy> close to a year ago, now
01:17 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: While the idea of a sex slave has led to much amusement, I was thinking more along the lines of von Braun and the other Nazi scientists.
01:18 < Admiral_Skippy> she was my last steady 
01:18  * Admiral_Skippy has entered the melancholy phase
01:18 < Admiral_Skippy> and yes AI i know you can win a pissing contest with me about that, you better have made a profile by now
01:18 < Erik_Tuber> Oh my god Skippy that just sounds, oh god jus tthinking about that is 
01:18 <+Miura> if a character concept gives you an erection
01:18 < Erik_Tuber> Eeeeeeeeh!
01:18 <+Miura> how can it be bad!
01:19 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: What, the splinter? 
01:19 < Erik_Tuber> Point.
01:19 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: didn't go that far in
01:19 < AI_Beta> Miura	if a character concept gives you an erection
01:19 < AI_Beta> Miura	how can it be bad!
01:19 < AI_Beta> STAHP!
01:19 < Erik_Tuber> Ic know
01:19 < Admiral_Skippy> Miura: CONTINUE!
01:19 < Erik_Tuber> But in the theigh 
01:19 <+Miura> if I can't fap to a character I don't play it!
01:19 < Erik_Tuber> And close to the femoral
01:19 < Erik_Tuber> Oh god.
01:19 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: yeah that wasn't funny
01:20 < Admiral_Skippy> she came out competely uscathed

01:20 < AI_Beta> Miura	if I can't fap to a character I don't play it! <- You play a closeted furry!
01:20 < Admiral_Skippy> then heel-kicked me in the crotch as she was trying to stand up
01:20 <+RangerKarl> outright calling himself out as a kafir in arabic in his own sig
01:20 <+Miura> I'm not a closeted furry
01:20 <+Miura> and neither is Rum'rr
01:20 < Erik_Tuber> Oh god.

01:20 <@|Minow|> yeah I noticed that too RangerKarl
01:20 <+Miura> it's hard not to be
01:20 < Admiral_Skippy> which meant my hand shook as i was trying to pull out the splinter
01:20 <+Miura> when you're a caitian 
01:20 < Erik_Tuber> Skippy OH
01:20 < AI_Beta> I mean as in homosexual.

01:21 <+Miura> Hmmmm
01:21 < Admiral_Skippy> nah

01:21 < Erik_Tuber> Man that must have been awkward.
01:22 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: we laughed it off mostly
01:22 < AI_Beta> Miura	how open is the UFP about gays anyway <- Based on what we actually see in the show, homosexuals don't exist.
01:22 < Admiral_Skippy> not as bad as the time she threw me partway through the windo
01:22 < Admiral_Skippy> landlady was pissed about that one, and also worried for me
01:23 <+Miura> so Star Wars is more tolerant
01:23 < AI_Beta> Admiral_Skippy: She sounds like a psycho.
01:23 < Erik_Tuber> What the he.ll
01:23 < Admiral_Skippy> wheras the bed we managed to get her to believe was an accident
01:23 <+Miura> with planet gay
01:23 <+Miura> ONE MORE REASON SW>ST
01:23 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: Erik_Tuber:  No, we were sparring in the bedrrom, it was fucnny
01:23 < Admiral_Skippy> we just shouldn't have done it next to the window
01:24 < Admiral_Skippy> and she shouldn't have tried so hard to get the training knife off me at the expense of her footing
01:24 < Erik_Tuber> I know /that/ just-wait training knife
01:24 < Erik_Tuber> Okay so that wasn't a euphamism
01:24 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: naw
01:24 <+Airawolfra> AI_Beta: As in, she got out before the Orions were sold to the KDF or she... was extracted?
01:24 < Erik_Tuber> Otherwise I would be concerned.
01:24 < Admiral_Skippy> it's a tough flexible plastic dagger
01:25 < Erik_Tuber> Oh.
01:25 < Admiral_Skippy> we did kali together, twas how we met, you probably know it better as escrima
01:26 < Erik_Tuber> Okay now I'm just confused. 
01:26 < AI_Beta> Airawolfra: Actually, I was thinking perhaps Thanatos could extract me.  Than, don't you want to rescue a Space Nazi scientist?
01:26 <+Miura> I still like the idea of having extracted AI 
01:26 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: how so?
01:26 <+Miura> or thanatos can
01:26 < Admiral_Skippy> Erik_Tuber: how so?
01:26 < Erik_Tuber> Nevermind.
01:26 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: quoted you erroneously, sorry

01:29 <+Airawolfra> I remember that quote
01:29 <+Miura> I just like knives a lot
01:29 <+Miura> is the main thing
01:29 < Admiral_Skippy> Miura: they're cool, yes : )
01:30 < Admiral_Skippy> mostly though, the main thing becoming basically profficient in kali over the last three years has taught me is how little i want to be in a knife fight, lol
01:31 < Admiral_Skippy> the "winner" is the one who walks into A&E rather than is wheeled in, bascially
01:31 < AI_Beta> That means the Kali master did his job!

01:31 < Thanatos> At that point
01:31 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: plus i read a lot of Marc MacYoung, just to ram the point home
01:32 < Thanatos> Walker is actually a walking murder machine
01:32 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: i mean, there are situations, if i'd fucked up every much more effective non-violent self defence technique, where i'd prepare to try to be the guy who walks in
01:32 < Thanatos> People go "Why did they go along with him?"
01:32 < Erik_Tuber> So is his brain
01:32 < Admiral_Skippy> AI_Beta: but dear god the thought fills me only with horror
01:33 < Thanatos> And the answer is clearly: Because do you honestly think they can take Walker? :V

01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> I'm sorry Grin_Reaper, i love you really
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: haha, I do 
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: oh wait
01:50 <@Grin_Reaper> I'm not sure that makes me any safer from your gang of shaven lackeys >:(
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> Admiral_Skippy: no, in that case
01:50 <+Thanatos> I don't mind answering questions
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: it's a literal fucking badger den lol
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> this was a thing that happened
01:50 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: I can't actually order stuff like that, don't worry
01:50 <@Grin_Reaper> mauled to death by literal angry badgers?
01:51 <+Exposure> also I figured out why I didn't get anything back from EA when I signed up for that beta for Ultima Forever oh so long ago
01:51 <+Exposure> I didn't think they were going make it a mobile game. :P
01:51 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: i think he oded and then they dragged him in there, or something

01:52 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: they only chewed him a little
01:52 <+I00thlurker> I bring that up because earlier in a certain thread, Avernus posited that a greek fire thrower might be able to hurt an abrams given enough time 
01:52 <@Grin_Reaper> It's hard for badgers to do CPR :<
01:52 <+I00thlurker> but I can't remember any Abrams being disabled because of a little napalm

01:52 < HarryLeferts> Exposure, why are you liking me posts in Thanatos' thread?
01:52 <+Thanatos> [18:51] <+I00thlurker> right, would a molotov cocktail to the engine hurt an abrams?
01:52 <+Laird> any intresting threads on SB I missed out on in the last few hours?
01:52 < HarryLeferts> :p
01:52 <+Thanatos> Depends where you throw it

01:53 <+I00thlurker> Ahhh
01:53 < HarryLeferts> Ah.
01:53 <+Thanatos> The intake you don't want burning stuff on
01:54 <+Thanatos> Enough will cause the engine to shut down
01:54 <+Thanatos> From lack of intake
01:54 <+Airawolfra> Thanatos wait! He's one of the suspected muslamics!
01:54 <+I00thlurker> Ah, right
01:55 <+I00thlurker> so if enough byzantines with a death wish
01:55 <+cloakie> are there incindiary anti-tank bombs?
01:55 <+I00thlurker> carrying pots of greek fire 
01:55 <+I00thlurker> it's possible to at least immobilize it? :p
01:55 <+Thanatos> Yes, if they let you
01:55 <+cloakie> If they can kill the engine, wouldn't it be able to kill a tank easier than a regular bomb?
01:55 <+I00thlurker> *with enough*
01:55 <+Thanatos> Like
01:55 <+Thanatos> That's how it works
01:55 <+Thanatos> For literally any engine
01:55 <@Grin_Reaper> That doesn't really kill the engine, though
01:55 <+Admiral_Skippy> cloakie: only if it's not being driven by thanatos
01:55 <+Thanatos> The Challenger 2
01:56 <@Grin_Reaper> The tank still works once the fire is out
01:56 <+Thanatos> Got disabled by molotovs
01:56 <+Admiral_Skippy> cloakie: he slaps the bombs out of the air with his cock
01:56 <+Thanatos> The issue with the Abrams is its intake points straight up
01:56 <+Thanatos> And is on the edge of the hull
01:56 <+I00thlurker> [21:55]	Thanatos	Yes, if they let you
01:56 <+Admiral_Skippy> Thanatos: ah
01:56 <+I00thlurker> well I'm already giving them a leg up

01:56 <+Thanatos> So water can spill over
01:56 <+cloakie> An engine can work after being lit on fire?
01:56 <+I00thlurker> insofar as they're not lugging around a gigantic iron pot

01:56 <+Thanatos> Like
01:56 <+I00thlurker> :p
01:57 <+Thanatos> I have an aborted post about this
01:57 <+Thanatos> "During the invasion of Iraq they had these really terrible fuel bladders mounted on the turret that if hit could easily kill the engines simply by flooding the intake on top of the chance of being on fire"
01:57 <+Exposure> you know I've completely forgotten about that "hurr i'm going make trivalize suicide" bit Foamy
01:57 <+Admiral_Skippy> Thanatos: fuck
01:58 <+Thanatos> Like, fucking ton of fuel
01:59 <+Thanatos> The thing about the ammonia that I was too pissed at the time to deal with
01:59 <+Admiral_Skippy> what brains trust came up with this?
01:59 <@Grin_Reaper> The same ones that gave it an ammo stowage system straight from about 1940?
01:59 <+Thanatos> Nah, this is the Abrams Grin
01:59 <+Admiral_Skippy> Grin_Reaper: hahahaha
01:59 <+Admiral_Skippy> i retract my laughter 
01:59 <+Thanatos> Its people who say that logistics matter more than tactics :V
01:59 <@Grin_Reaper> oh, I thought you were talking about the Challenger 2
01:59 <+Admiral_Skippy> Thanatos: : (
02:00 <+Thanatos> Without realizing that everything matters
02:00 <+Admiral_Skippy> Thanatos: And don't have to drive the damn thing themselves?
02:00 <+Thanatos> So they go "how can I get more fuel on here"
02:00 <+Admiral_Skippy> what a bunch of cuntwasps
02:00 <+Thanatos> "Strap it to the side" said Great Leader Kim
02:00 <+Thanatos> As he and a young aide hopped in a jeep and
02:00 <+Thanatos> Wait, wrong thing :V
02:00 <+Admiral_Skippy> Thanatos: like seriously "let's cover the tank in a flammable substance just above it's engine intake" is something you'd say as a fucking joke
02:00 <+Admiral_Skippy> i don't even
02:01 <+Admiral_Skippy> fuck my balls
02:01 <+Thanatos> I seriously need to make more use
02:01 <+Thanatos> Of that North Korean story line
02:01 <+Thanatos> Because its the funniest damn thing
02:01 <+Falchion> North Korean storyline...?
02:01 <+Miura> sisko looks weird with hair
02:01 <+Thanatos> Falchion
02:01 <+Admiral_Skippy> I wanted to hear the story of Great Leader Kim and his young aide
02:01 <+Admiral_Skippy> it sounded like it might get racy
02:01 <+Thanatos> Old North Korean propaganda cliche
02:01 <+Falchion> Ah, 'kay.
02:02 <+Thanatos> Great Leader is in his office
02:02 <+Thanatos> A young, enthusiastic but kinda naive and dumb aide
02:02 <+Thanatos> Comes to him
02:02 <+Thanatos> With a problem
02:02  * Admiral_Skippy eagerly listens
02:02 <+Falchion> By the way, if I ever get this Warez story going as an actual video game, I'll need someone to call me out on the vehicle design.
02:02 <+Thanatos> Kim, in a fit of childlike spontanaety (or however thats spelled)
02:02 <+Thanatos> Immediately comes up with an idea
02:03 <+Thanatos> The young aide wonders how he and everyone else did not think of it
02:03 <+Admiral_Skippy> dis gonna b good
02:03 <+Thanatos> And he and Kim hop into a jeep
02:03 <+Thanatos> And peel out
02:03 <+Admiral_Skippy> deliver the punchline you cocktease
02:03 <+Thanatos> To go fix the problem personally
02:03 <+Falchion> Heh.
02:03 <+Admiral_Skippy> haha
02:03 <+Thanatos> Also
02:04 <+Thanatos> Kim drives
02:04 <+Thanatos> In the stories
02:04 <+Thanatos> Like
02:04 <+Thanatos> His child like exuberance demands it
02:04 <+Miura> Airawolfra: I'm watching the "meeting the dominion" trilogy 
02:04 <+Thanatos> The most famous one of these stories
02:04 <@Grin_Reaper> that seems like it should be capitalized
02:04 <@Grin_Reaper> Childlike Exuberance
02:04 <+Thanatos> Yes
02:04 <+Thanatos> Its a very important part of Nork propaganda
02:05 <+Thanatos> He cannot be a man in deep thought
02:05 <+Admiral_Skippy> Along with his motherly doughy physique
02:05 -!- Exposure is now known as SleepingExposure
02:05 <+Thanatos> Yes
02:05 <+Thanatos> Actually
02:05 <+Thanatos> But the most famouse (infamous?) of these stories goes like this
02:05 <+Thanatos> Kim is up late, probably doing a junior jumble
02:05 <+Thanatos> A young aide comes in
02:05  * Admiral_Skippy knows the hour invested watching the video lecture of The Cleanest Race was time well spent
02:06 <+Thanatos> "Sir we don't have enough fertilizer to last this season"
02:06 <+Thanatos> Kim thinks about it for one second
02:06 <+Admiral_Skippy> haha
02:06 <+Thanatos> Snaps to his feet
02:06 <+Thanatos> and goes "USE LESS FERTILIZER"
02:06 <+Admiral_Skippy> BRILLIANCE!!!
02:06 <+Thanatos> The aide dope slaps himself
02:06 <+Thanatos> "Of course!"
02:06 <+Thanatos> They hop in a jeep
02:06 <+Thanatos> Kim behind the wheel
02:06 <+Thanatos> And speed off to a farm to tell them this
02:07 <+Admiral_Skippy> MY NETHERS ARE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT AT HIS GLORY

02:07 <+Thanatos> I like to imagine

02:07 <+Thanatos> And going "Man, I can't wait to see how this one ends!"
02:08 <+Admiral_Skippy> hahaha
02:08 <+Admiral_Skippy> like power rangers
02:08 <+Falchion> Thanatos: I ever pass the Sullivan by you?
02:08 <+Admiral_Skippy> "I wonder if they'll form the megazord or not this episode?"
02:08 <+Falchion> Weird bastard child of a Chieftain and an M60?
02:08 <+Admiral_Skippy> "Oooh the suspense is killing me!"
02:08 <+I00thlurker> Voltron that shit.
02:08 <+Airawolfra> Lol
02:10 <+Lambo> someone needs to photoshop the hulk flying a Chaika

02:12 <+I00thlurker> I'm just imagining him wearing it around his waist, with his legs having bust through the undercarriage

02:34 <+AI_Beta> Like a Defiant-class ship.
02:34 <+AI_Beta> But for a single person, I suppose a runabout or an updated version of the Delta Flyer would make more sense.
02:34 <+Thanatos> Flying somewhere risky is actually in his core competencies lol
02:35 <+AI_Beta> Indeed.
02:35 <+AI_Beta> Which is why you're going to have to come up with something for him to screw up. :V
02:35 <+Thanatos> But this is where he's good :*(
02:36 <+Thanatos> I imagine he could be REALLY ANNOYING the entire time

02:37 <+Airawolfra> Feel free to work that in!
02:38 <+Thanatos> I like the Corsair :(
02:38 <+AI_Beta> Corsair?
02:38 <+Thanatos> Also the BF109
02:38 <+Miura> mellian: what sort of things do you normally wear
02:38 <+RangerKarl> it looks like an iron
02:38 <+RangerKarl> everybody likes the BF109
02:38 <+Miura> on your average day out
02:38 <+Thanatos> 35% of all pilots killed
02:38 <+Miura> what would you have on
02:38 <+Thanatos> Were killed on landing
02:38 <+Thanatos> Just landing
02:38 <+Thanatos> Not coming in hot
02:39 <+RangerKarl> dat narrow undercarriage
02:39 <+Thanatos> Just trying to land the god damn thing
02:39 <@|Minow|> ensign eliminator!
02:39 < mellian> safe to say, aside from some derby tops and jeans, all my clothes basically shade of black and dark gray :p
02:39 <+Thanatos> Because the landing gear had a tendency to snap right off
02:39 <+Miura> gross
02:40 <+Thanatos> The first P47 was much politer and would instead prop strike on takeoff :V
02:40 <+Thanatos> Because it had no clearance

02:50 <+I00thlurker>  /how/
02:50 < EricD> My feelings towards the latest installments of A Song of Ice and Fire are... Rather ambivalent
02:50 <+RangerKarl> [10:49] <+TM_Work> because they're pulling back all the records before paging
02:50 <+RangerKarl> not sure who designed the backend there...
02:51 < EricD> Stupid GRRM with his brilliant setting and characters and overbloated shit plot
02:51 <+Thanatos> Can I just say
02:51 <+Thanatos> A Song of Fire and Ice
02:51 <+Thanatos> Is probably one of the most pretentious titles I have ever heard :p
02:51 <+TM_Work> the html page that is returned has ALL of the records searched for
02:51 < EricD> Oh yeah
02:51 < EricD> Game of Thrones is way better as a title
02:51 <+Thanatos> Game of Thrones is a much-yes
02:51 <+TM_Work> when the page renders then the pagination is done
02:52 <+Thanatos> That's like calling your work a Cycle
02:52 < EricD> Ugh
02:52 <+I00thlurker> @ Thanatos or Saga
02:52 <+I00thlurker> :p
02:52 < EricD> Fucking Chris Paolini has the balls to call his books a "cycle"
02:52 <+TM_Work> I00thlurker, just a plain text html file
02:52 <+TM_Work> 25MB
02:52  * TM_Work headdesks
02:52 <+I00thlurker> @ TM dis file
02:52 <+TM_Work> that would explain why it takes IE about 10 secs to render the page
02:52 < Admiral_Skippy> the fuck?
02:52 <+I00thlurker> is un-fucking-believable 
02:52 < EricD> I00thlurker
02:53 < EricD> In my opinion
02:53 <+RangerKarl> [10:52] <EricD> Fucking Chris Paolini has the balls to call his books a "cycle"
02:53 <+I00thlurker> [/christopher walken]
02:53 <+RangerKarl> the kid has gumption
02:53 < EricD> You don't get to call your stories a "saga" unless you sing them
02:53 < EricD> In alliterative verse
02:53 < EricD> In Old English
02:53 <+TM_Work> this being IE10 so the actually quite good one
02:53 <+I00thlurker> The only time I've accepted "Saga" in a title
02:53 <+TM_Work> :/
02:53 <+I00thlurker> was Panzer Dragoon Saga
02:53 <+RangerKarl> the only time I've accepted saga
02:53 <+RangerKarl> was the proton saga
02:53 < Admiral_Skippy> haha
02:53 <+I00thlurker> and that was ONE GAME, not a promise for sequels 
02:53 <+I00thlurker> :p
02:53 <+RangerKarl> but it's a shitty car so whatever
02:53 < Admiral_Skippy> if i write fantasy now
02:54 < havocfett> Cycles should be bloody /cyclical/, and sagas should be in verse. :|
02:54 < Admiral_Skippy> imma call it "the saga cycle" just to piss you all off
02:54 < EricD> It's not a saga unless you have alliterative verse and are reciting it in Old English
02:54 <+RangerKarl> hwaet?
02:54 < Admiral_Skippy> tee hee
02:54 <+I00thlurker> @ Skippy that's bloody nonsense
02:54 < EricD> HWAET
02:54 <+I00thlurker> HWAET
02:54 < Admiral_Skippy> I00thlurker: I KNOW
02:54 <+Fivemarks> How to troll BLS players: 10 Core Space Monster with cores that can only be damaged by antimatter weapons
02:54 <+Miura> ST ships can go to warp with only one nacelle operational, right? 
02:54 < Admiral_Skippy> I00thlurker: AND IT WILL BECOME A FUCKING BESTSELLER
02:54 <+RangerKarl> I like to imagine that was the olde english version of
02:54 <+RangerKarl> WOT
02:54 <+I00thlurker> Is it a comedy book, Skippy? :P
02:54 < EricD> We Gardena in geardagum
02:54 < Admiral_Skippy> I00thlurker: BECAUSE IT WILL BE LORD OF THE RINGS GIVEN THE TWILIGHT TREATMENT
02:54 <+McPwned> <+Miura> im sure voyager did at some point
02:55 < EricD> Ã¾eodcyninga Ã¾rym gefrunon, 
02:55 < Admiral_Skippy> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
02:55 < EricD> hu Ã°a Ã¦Ã¾elingas ellen fremedon. 
02:55 <+I00thlurker> @ Rangerkarl now I'm imagining Na'avi flying around Link's head shouting "Hey, hey HWAET"
02:55 < EricD> Oft Scyld Scefing  sceaÃ¾ena Ã¾reatum
02:55 <+Miura> there are single-nacelle starships
02:55 <+TM_Work> so for this page. It takes 12 seconds for the server to fully respond
02:55 <+McPwned> that doesnt mean that 2 nacelled ones dont require 2
02:56 < EricD> That was some Beowulf for you guys
02:56 < EricD> You've been cultured now
02:56 <+TM_Work> it then takes the browser another 12 seconds to render and fire the pageload event
02:56 < EricD> :P
02:56 <+McPwned> just that its possible to design a single nacelled ship
02:56 <+I00thlurker> @ TM 
02:56 <+I00thlurker> O.o
02:56 <+TM_Work> O_O
02:56 <+I00thlurker> that is one fucked up file
02:57 <+TM_Work> the only thing it has in its favor is being about the worst case possible
02:57 <+TM_Work> where 5600 records are returned
02:57 <+TM_Work> worst case for this app
02:57 <+Lambo> Airawolfra: CHAIKA STRONG
02:57 <+TM_Work> but still, 25MB. O_O
02:57 <+Lambo> paginate!
02:57 <+RangerKarl> I don't understand why it doesn't just feed the user the whatever number of records per page
02:57 <+Miura> McPwned: well it would make sense to have a backup for a warship
02:57 <+RangerKarl> instead of offloading everything at once like that
02:57 <+Miura> battleships and dreadnoughts and such often have three
02:57 <+Miura> sometimes four
02:58 <+Airawolfra> CHAIKA STRONG
02:58 <+Airawolfra> Miura
02:58 <+McPwned> yeah its suggestive evidence but not conclusive
02:58 <+TM_Work> Lambo, it is paginating!
02:58 <+Airawolfra> That is because they actually have two sets of warp coils in once nacelle
02:58 <+TM_Work> entierly in the browser. O_O
02:58 <+RangerKarl> why not server-side ;_;
02:58 <+Airawolfra> if you have a two nacelled ship and try to go to warp with only one nacelle operational
02:58 <+TM_Work> because fail, that's why
02:58 <+RangerKarl> portion the replies out
02:58 <+Airawolfra> you rip the ship in half
02:58 <+RangerKarl> ;_;
02:58 <+Lambo> Airawolfra: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1357110/WT/shot%202013.06.17%2022.09.39.jpg
02:58 <+Miura> so why not have two sets of warp coils in each nacelle of a two nacelle ship
02:59 <+Lambo> my poor plane
02:59 <+Airawolfra> Lambo and I are an effective team
02:59 <+McPwned> cost
02:59 <+Lambo> glided for about 2 miles
02:59 <+Lambo> lol
02:59 <+Lambo> possibly more
02:59 <+Lambo> and I nearly landed it!
02:59 <+Lambo> then some asshole shot me
02:59 <+Thanatos> Man, Chaika
02:59 <+Airawolfra> Chaika is fly!
02:59 <+Lambo> :(
02:59 <+Thanatos> Is perfect for snap shots
02:59 <+RangerKarl> it has all the manuver authority

03:00 <+Miura> I like the name Airawolfra 
03:00 <+Miura> it's cute 
03:00 <+Thanatos> Like I was playing in the biplane tiers
03:00 <+Thanatos> And I was just taking snap shots
03:00 <+Lambo> same Thanatos
03:00 <+Thanatos> "Pilot unconcious"
03:00 <+IronWolf> Myabe you'll see it again Miura!
03:00 <+Lambo> it was Chaikawolf

03:00 <+Lambo> low tier dogfights

03:01 <+Lambo> are fucking insane
03:01 <+Lambo> especially with biplanes
03:01 <+RangerKarl> I love it

03:01 <+Lambo> one mission
03:01 <+Lambo> about 7 people were chasing down one hurricane
03:01 <+Lambo> it was fucking hilarious
03:02 <+Lambo> I think I got that kill though
03:02 <+Lambo> lol
03:02 < Admiral_Skippy> haha
03:02 <+IronWolf> You should be LaGGbo

03:02 <+Lambo> haha
03:02 < DonBosco> question: What's a good windows IRC client?
03:02 <+Miura> kvirc
03:02 <+Lambo> mIRC

03:02 <+TM_Work> irssi
03:02 <+IronWolf> Mibbit!

03:03 <+Lambo> sadly bitchx 
03:03 <+Lambo> is dead :(
03:03 <+Miura> hey IronWolf
03:04 <+Miura> Do the Task Force Omega ships of 2414 have families and science facilities aboard
03:04 <+Thanatos> [20:02] <+IronWolf> You should be LaGGbo
03:04 <+Thanatos> [20:02] <+IronWolf> and I should be ChiakaWolf
03:04 <+Thanatos> TOGETHER YOU FIGHT THE BOURGEOIS
03:05 <+IronWolf> Miura
03:05 <+IronWolf> they are on the frontlines
03:05 <+IronWolf> what do you think? :P
03:05 <+IronWolf> They probably have science facilties aboard
03:05 <+Thanatos> Well
03:05 <+IronWolf> but no families
03:05 <+Thanatos> Its starfleet
03:05 <+IronWolf> SHHHH THANATOS
03:05 <+Thanatos> They had a shopping mall on the Ent-D
03:05 <+Thanatos> And dolphin tanks
03:06 <+Lambo> (23:07:43) <+Thanatos> TOGETHER YOU FIGHT THE BOURGEOIS  <-- I'd watch it
03:06 <+Miura> I am inclined to believe Thanatos here
03:06 <+IronWolf> Indeed
03:06 <+IronWolf> What Thanatos is saying
03:06 <+Miura> dolphin tanks are great though
03:06 <+IronWolf> is actually 100% true
03:06 <+Random832> i'm pretty sure it's implied in secondary material that there are dolphin crew members
03:06 <+IronWolf> Well
03:06 <+Miura> who wouldn't want a dolphin on their warship
03:06 <+Random832> it's not, like, a zoo
03:06 <+IronWolf> if you believe the TNG Technreadout
03:06 <+Miura> SeaQuest had one
03:06 <+Miura> SeaQuest was great
03:06 <+RangerKarl> goddamnit just listening to the eureka AO op gets me depressed
03:06 <+Miura> therefore if you have dolphins you are great
03:06 <+Thanatos> The tech manuals
03:06 <+RangerKarl> because of how crap that show ended up being
03:06 <+IronWolf> I like to pretend that dolphin thing doesn't exist
03:06 <+Thanatos> Were pretty bad
03:06 <+SleepIsEasy> So
03:06 <+SleepIsEasy> I redesigned my launcher
03:06 <+SleepIsEasy> http://awesome.redial.net/KSP%20-%20Carnivore%20has%20cleared%20the%20tower.png
03:07 <+IronWolf> because it felt like I was reading crack at that part
03:07 <+RangerKarl> [11:05] <+Thanatos> They had a shopping mall on the Ent-D
03:07 <+RangerKarl> but
03:07 <+RangerKarl> nobody has any money
03:07 <+IronWolf> Anyways miura they are warships
03:07 < EricD> The Ent-D had a bunch of stupid crap
03:07 <+Lambo> SleepIsEasy: ...
03:07 <+IronWolf> and science vessels for support
03:07 <+Thanatos> The Ent-D tech manual
03:07 <+Thanatos> Is impossibly 80s

03:07 <+IronWolf> I actually have it!
03:07 <+Thanatos> Was Picard in a pastel sports jacket and t-shirt
03:07 <+RangerKarl> I always thought the manual was just a whole bunch of injokes
03:08 <+Lambo> lol WinBosco went mIRC
03:08 <+Lambo> best client ever
03:08 <+IronWolf> it's like
03:08 <+IronWolf> "The hull is made from a duranium-tritium alloy
03:08 <+IronWolf> Like
03:08 <+IronWolf> is that good
03:08 <+IronWolf> bad
03:08 <+IronWolf> what tech manual?
03:08 < WinBosco> Lambo: It apparently wants me to pay for it after 30 days so I'll probably switch to something else
03:08 <+IronWolf> YOU MADE THOSE WORDS UP NOW EXPLAIN
03:08 <+Random832> did it say tritium or tritanium?
03:08 <+Lambo> WinBosco: it'll just keep nagging you
03:08 <+IronWolf> Who fucking knows
03:08  * DonBosco is a cheap bastard
03:08 <+IronWolf> they were made up
03:08 <+Random832> because tritanium is a trek space magic metal
03:08 <+Lambo> but won't stop working
03:08 <+RangerKarl> just crack the sucker
03:08 <+Random832> tritium is radioactive hydrogen
03:08 <+RangerKarl> let khaled continue to suffer

03:09 <+Lambo> I do
03:09 <+Lambo> I pay for a good IRC client
03:09 <+McPwned> star trek sounds like science its not science
03:09 <+Random832> you paid for mirc
03:09 <+Lambo> that has a license restriction of naught
03:09 <+McPwned> dont get confused
03:09 <+Random832> if you'd paid for irssi, that'd be one thing
03:09 <+Lambo> if I'd paid for irssi
03:09 <+Random832> literally every other irc client except for mirc is free
03:10 <+Lambo> i'd have been ripped off

03:10 <+Lambo> and they're all terrible shit
03:10 <+TM_Work> Random832, XChat for windows
03:10 <+Random832> well except for the one windows build of xchat that we don't talk about
03:10 <@Grin_Reaper> HexChat
03:10 <+TM_Work> is a small fee
03:10 <+Lambo> all shit
03:10 <@Grin_Reaper> HexChat is free :v
03:10 <+Lambo> except xchat
03:10 <+TM_Work> though there are severl windows builds of the source
03:10  * WinBosco notes that he has *way* too much technology around him despite his luddite desires
03:10 <+Random832> TM_Work: only if you get the thief's "official" build
03:10 <+TM_Work> as it is opensource
03:10 <+Lambo> I used Xchat for a while
03:10 <+Lambo> didn't like it
03:10 <+Lambo> went back to mIRC
03:11 <+Lambo> I think I paid like $9.99
03:11 <+Lambo> was on sale
03:11 <+Lambo> yup
03:11 <+Lambo> $10
03:11 <+Random832> does anyone else remember pirch?

03:14 <+Random832> RangerKarl: the day before I discovered 7zip
03:14 <+Lambo> WinRAR ftw
03:14 <+Lambo> then I started using 7Zip
03:14 <+Lambo> lol
03:14 <+RangerKarl> he's a pretty blatant troll
03:14 <+RangerKarl> dissing muslims in his sig
03:14 < WinBosco> I don't see his sig?
03:14 <+RangerKarl> some multipart archives don't play well with 7zip
03:14 <+McPwned> i used winrar for ever
03:14 <+RangerKarl> some of the older warez stuff
03:14 <+Random832> i think for a while i had a volume-licensed copy of winzip that I'd "acquired" from my high school

03:16 < WinBosco> someone correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it a thing among white nationalists to marry Hispanic ladies, "because they know their place" or something like that?
03:16 < WinBosco> white supremacists rather

03:17 <+Random832> him saying that after you suggested it doesn't make it a "thing".

03:19 <@|Minow|> Lord_Squishy: I think the "he can't be racist, he married a panamanian" one might be even better though!
03:19 <@|Minow|> because you know, there are two races: white and panamanian
03:19 <@|Minow|> if you are one and you married the other, you can't be a racist!
03:19 <+Thanatos> Until the guy with the Eagle
03:19 <+Thanatos> Goes "fuck it"
03:20 <+Thanatos> And jumps off the ship
03:20 <+Random832> eh not really in the mood for listening to music now
03:20 <+Thanatos> Yelling that if they want to keep the eagle
03:20 <+Random832> might look at it later

03:42 <+Thanatos> Kratman thinks you can disable a tank by throwing ammonia on it
03:42 <+Thanatos> But the engines superheat the air
03:42 <+Thanatos> And so it would just seperate into its component parts

04:25 < EricD> I thought we were sharing dA art...
04:26 <+AI_Beta> Falchion: I see you're hunting down terrible art again.
04:26 <+Falchion> Yep.
04:26 <+Falchion> Nothing better to spend my time on.
04:26 <+Falchion> Helps me feel better about the armor designs I'm doing, at least.
04:26 <+AI_Beta> Probably more fun than trying to work on art for your portfolio.
04:27 <+Falchion> Yep.
04:27 < EricD> Look up Abe Papakhian for good art
04:27 < EricD> I love his Tolkien and Martin art
04:28 < EricD> He's one of my big inspirations for House of Elendil actually
04:28 <+AI_Beta> Or dealing with annoying arses who take one look at your art and want you to change all things.
04:28 <+AI_Beta> *ALL OF THEM*
04:28 <+Miura> apparently there are only gays in the mirror universe 
04:29 <+Miura> fits with the whole roman thing I guess
04:29 < mellian> bah, IE should stop being the browser standard already
04:29 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: You mean like you? :P
04:29 < Fivemarks> Takei exists in all universes
04:29 <+AI_Beta> Falchion: Dammit, *I* was going to make that joke!
04:29 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: Well, at least I'm not on a schedule for the Orion, real or imagined.
04:29 < EricD> http://abepapakhian.deviantart.com/art/Ned-s-Justice-126482645
04:29 <+Falchion> Because YUIOP WON'T STOP BOTHERING ME ABOUT IT.
04:29 <+AI_Beta> And I'm not trying to push you.
04:30 <+Laird> bothering you about what?
04:30 <+AI_Beta> YUIOP is bothering you about the art you're doing for me?
04:30 < mellian> some bureaucracy and admin sites still base their CMS sites on IE, or have not updated since yet. 
04:30 <+Falchion> Laird: His ODST/Nanosuit thing.
04:30 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: Nah, his own stuff.
04:30 <+Miura> I wonder if they'll make a new series
04:30 <+Miura> or if they're content with movies
04:30 <+Laird> lol, you mean his knock off of my armor?
04:30 <+Falchion> Laird: Apparently, yeah.
04:30 <+Laird> Tell him to fuck off.
04:31 < EricD> http://abepapakhian.deviantart.com/art/The-Execution-of-Ned-Stark-126256146

04:31 <+Apocal> man
04:31 <+Laird> Can I buy his armor design from you just to troll him?:D
04:31 <+Apocal> you know
04:31 <+AI_Beta> Laird	if he isn't paying you, you owe him shit. <- Watch it.  You give YUIOP that and he's liable to fling it back at you.
04:32 <+Apocal> i keep forgetting that people talk to differently in the military vs. civilian world
04:32 <+Laird> Why?
04:32 <+Falchion> Laird: Eh...lemme get back to you on the price once I'm done GOUGING THE SHIT out of it.
04:32 <+Miura> how so?
04:32 <+Miura> aw yeah
04:32 <+Miura> a Riker episode
04:32 <+Falchion> I figure if he wants the piece so badly, he can pay an easy $145 for lines and flats.
04:32 <+AI_Beta> Laird	Why? <- Because he's a goddamn chimp, that's why.
04:32 <+Falchion> Which he can't.
04:32 <+Laird> Beta how is he able to send it my way? I didn't make a deal with YUIOP. Falchion is doing it for free from how I understand it.
04:33 < EricD> That's one scene I wish we could have seen in Game of Thrones
04:33 <+Falchion> Because mommy and daddy didn't give him enough allowance.
04:33 <+Falchion> Laird: Milk of human kindness. Also, the piece itself is REALLY SIMPLE.
04:33 < EricD> Eddard Stark entering the throne room of the Red Keep on horseback
04:33 <+Laird> So if Fal doesn't feel like giving his talents away for free YUIOP has no grounds to say bupkiss.
04:33 < EricD> Jaime Lannister sitting on the throne
04:33 < EricD> The dragon skulls staring down
04:33 < mellian> it is worse if IE declares the site as unsafe, sigh
04:33 < EricD> I always loved the imagery of that scene
04:33 <+Laird> @beta LOL!
04:33 <+Falchion> Laird: EXCEPT HE WON'T STOP PESTERING ME ABOUT IT.
04:33 <+Laird> you made my evening with that comment.
04:33 <+Falchion> HAY FALCHION, WHEN YOU DONE WITH IT?
04:33 <+Laird> Hit the ignore button?
04:34 <+AI_Beta> Falchion	I figure if he wants the piece so badly, he can pay an easy $145 for lines and flats. <- I don't want a picture of my character THAT badly. O_O
04:34 <+Falchion> Heh, I should...
04:34 <+Falchion> But it's kinda funny. Sort of like tormenting the retards in the Special Ed class.
04:34 <+Laird> whats wrong with that?
04:34 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: Oh, for NORMAL people, I have a less gougey price range. :)
04:34 <+Falchion> Laird: Exactly.
04:34 <+Laird> they get some excitement, and you get a larf.
04:35 < havocfett> Demand payment, yes.
04:35 <+Falchion> havocfett: That comes later.
04:35 <+Laird> Falchion you know what is hilarious?
04:35 <+Falchion> Some people act immediately mercenary. I prefer a more...drug dealer like approach to these things.
04:35 < havocfett> Hah
04:35 <+Falchion> First taste's free. :D
04:35 <+Laird> When you mentioned YUIOPs design. I had my art guy whip up my version just to troll him.:D
04:36 <+Falchion> Heh, figured as much. Well worth it.
04:36 <+Laird> twisting the knife a little.
04:37 <+Laird> How far along are you with his design btw?
04:37 <+AI_Beta> Falchion	First taste's free. <- Heh.  I'd actually seriously thought about having you as a concept artist if I ever got to the point where I felt ready to move forward with the indie game I've been planning off and on.
04:37 <+Falchion> ...About finished, actually.
04:37 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: REASONABLE RATES. ONLY YOUR FIRST FIRSTBORN.
04:38 <+AI_Beta> I was hoping you'd settle for reasonable commissions plus perhaps a small royalty.
04:38 <+Robo_Jesus> ...wait, how in the hell does a "Second firstborn" even /work/?
04:38 <+Falchion> I mean, an in-house gig would be ideal, but...
04:38 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: Normal's salary-based unless we're talking freelance design.
04:39 <+Falchion> Robo_Jesus: I DEFY YOUR LOGIC.
04:39 <+AI_Beta> It would be freelance because it'd be freelance for /everyone./
04:39 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: And freelance design will make you hemorrhage the cash moneys out the ass.
04:40 <+AI_Beta> I'd probably only commission you enough for a kickstarter and revisit the deal after a successful campaign.
04:40 <+AI_Beta> Of course, if it feel through...well, no point in a salary, is there?
04:41 <+Robo_Jesus> Laird	: When you mentioned YUIOPs design. I had my art guy whip up my version just to troll him.:D   <---Link?
04:42 <+Falchion> AI_Beta: Heh, yeah.
04:42 < havocfett>  21:35	Falchion	First taste's free.  <- Note to self, if I decide to self publish a bunch of shorts
04:42 < havocfett> Hit up Falch for the freebie
04:42 < havocfett> :P
04:42 <+Falchion> havocfett: Mind you, the first taste is sort of barebones. Sort of.
04:43 <+AI_Beta> Hey, if the first one succeeds, you'd have plenty of money to revisit him for the next go round.
04:43 <+Falchion> Netted a short freelance gig by boring my employer half to death with FIFTEEN PAGES OF TECHNICAL DESIGNS PROVING THAT HE WAS STUPID.
04:43 <+Falchion> And that was the freebie.
04:43 < havocfett> Heh
04:43 <+Falchion> Admittedly, I dashed all of those off basically live and scanned them in as I went.
04:43 < havocfett> Man, all I want for my first book cover
04:44 < havocfett> Is something that isn't /horrifyingly/ /terrible/
04:44 <+Falchion> >book cover
04:44 <+Falchion> PREPARE TO PAY A SMALL FORTUNE.
04:44 <+Falchion> Also, self-published?
04:44 < havocfett> Not planning to
04:44 <+AI_Beta> havocfett: From the covers I've seen, you could probably clear that hurdle with a decent grasp of fucking Photoshop.
04:44 <+Falchion> Because most any legit publisher is going to actually farm it out to someone less...mercenary than me.
04:44 <+Falchion> Also, because lolPhotoshop.
04:45 < havocfett> It's a 'if I get published and suddenly have a bunch of shorts I can actually sell based on my name' thing
04:45 < havocfett> Where I will admit up front that this stuff is crap
04:45 < havocfett> And would charge, like, twenty cents each on amazon
04:45 < havocfett> :P
04:45 <+Falchion> Ah, gotcha.
04:45 <+Falchion> Still, prepare for monetary leakage from the rectum.
04:45 < havocfett> Heh
04:45 <+Falchion> Especially if you aren't the parasitic filth that infest the freelance employer waters.
04:46 <+Falchion> Which I trust you aren't.
04:46 < havocfett> I am not.
04:46 <+Falchion> Getting custom cover art these days is fucking expensive.
04:46 <+TM_Work> wheeee, adding new public private keypairs so I can login as different users without having to use a password. ^_^
04:46 <+Falchion> Like, proper expensive.
04:46 < havocfett> Ah
04:46 <+Falchion> Not even taking into account royalties from printing those things and selling those things on the front of books.
04:47 <+Falchion> Which is somewhat old-fashioned, but I need to make money to pay for my sixteen children, their medication, and the REST of my starving family somehow.
04:47 <+Falchion> ...Just kidding about the kids.

06:33 < utemia> you really need more than one thing that you enjoy together
06:33 < DogBoy> sup]
06:33 < utemia> for a relationship that lasts anyway
06:34 <+Apocal> I'm not sure about that, the most stable relationship I saw the two people could barely communicate with each other.
06:34 < utemia> hmm
06:35 < EricD> It all depends on the people involved
06:35 < utemia> yeah. sometimes it is a mystery
06:36 < EricD> Now me, I'm a reserved, emotionally closed off, distant, cold-hearted man who is also very possessive and jealous, therefore I don't date all that much. 
06:36 < utemia> you should put that in a classified add
06:36 <+Apocal> No, it is pretty simple: his sole standards in a woman is "regular sex and don't spend all my money."
06:36 <+Apocal> Her standard for a husband is simple too: have money and stay out of my kitchen.

06:37 <+Apocal> Yeah.
06:37 <+Apocal> Two with one on the way when I stopped keeping in touch.
06:37 < utemia> interesting
06:38 <+Apocal> This is the guy that was getting chicks off mail order bride sites btw.
06:38 < utemia> you know all those interesting people Apocal
06:38 < utemia> you should write a book :p
06:39 < utemia> i was only half kidding
06:39 <+Apocal> v0v i was in the military, there are a lot of weird people
06:40 < utemia> maybe in your military :<
06:40 < EricD> The military attracts strange folks
06:40 < utemia> ours just blew up ships to repair a broken dike
06:43 < EricD> Someone needs to sent out a PSA to all women, everywhere. Someone needs to tell them that when a guy likes them but they've met someone else, them saying "I hope you meet someone special too!" doesn't help nearly as much as they think it does
06:43 < utemia> aww
06:45 < EricD> Well it doesn't. It's a nice gesture and all and the intention is usually good but it doesn't make things any easier. 
06:46 < utemia> of course not
06:46 < utemia> but whatever you say in that situation will suck for the other
06:47 < utemia> what would you say to a woman in that situation if the positions were reversed?
06:49 <+Apocal> "lol"
06:50 <+Apocal> "that sucks"
06:51 < utemia> .. so eloquent
06:51 < utemia> lol
06:51 < PhoneFoam> Holy hell Robo Jesus, what have you done to my alerts?!
06:51 < EricD> Well I wouldn't know, I've never had the position be reversed
06:52 < EricD> I'd try to say something that isn't a meaningless platitude, but pretty much everything you can say in such a situation is
06:52 <+Apocal> man...
06:52 <+Apocal> that is nowhere near as awkward as i've had happen
06:53 < utemia> are you gonna share?
06:53 < EricD> Oh god fucking damn it
06:54 < EricD> I'm watching episode 8 of Game of Thrones season 3
06:54 < EricD> Daario just showed up
06:54 < utemia> the sexy viking
06:55 < EricD> The untrustworthy fuckhead
06:55 < utemia> apropos sexy viking, True Blood started again
06:56 < EricD> Oh yay, more fucking vampires. As if pop culture didn't have enough
06:56 < utemia> hehe
06:56 < utemia> I like those vampires
06:56 < utemia> they are like vampires are supposed to be
06:57 < utemia> more bram stokerish
06:58 < EricD> Do they look like Nosferatu?
06:58 < utemia> no
06:58 < utemia> but they're evil
06:58 < EricD> Well I want Nosferatu vampires to come back

07:01 < EricD> In the realm of folklore, few things are worse than what Anne Rice and Joss Whedon and Stephanie Meyer have done to vampires
07:01 < EricD> So no, I have no
07:01 < EricD> *not
07:02 < utemia> ah it isn't as bad as those
07:02 < utemia> not at all
07:02 < utemia> it is also based on books, and those are not my cuppa of tea
07:02 < EricD> Are the vampires pretty?
07:02 < utemia> but the series is hilarious
07:02 < utemia> some
07:02 < utemia> not all

07:03 < utemia> I think you could enjoy it
07:03 < EricD> Yeah, see I want old school vampires if I'm going to watch a vampire show. REAL old school. Vile, undead, unholy parasites upon the living. 
07:04 < utemia> read Dracula
07:04 < utemia> and it wouldn't make for a lot of interesting stories
07:04 < utemia> ambivalence is more interesting
07:05 < EricD> Have you ever played Diablo?
07:05 < utemia> no
07:05 < utemia> i don't like games
07:05 < EricD> Well in Diablo, there is no ambivalence about the villain.
07:05 < EricD> Diablo is fucking Satan. His evil is elemental
07:05 < EricD> That can be a perfectly compelling villain as well
07:06 < EricD> That's the sort of thing a vampire should be in my opinion, an elemental sort of evil
07:06 < utemia> I understand
07:06 < utemia> and they have those elements in True Blood
07:06 < utemia> just not to the degree that you prefer
07:07 < utemia> it is pretty hilarious, especially the 2nd season.
07:08 < utemia> I had fun watching it, and I hate the popculture vampires too
07:08 < utemia> after I read the first half of twilight I had to read Bram Stoker to cure my brain
07:10 < utemia> it is also a great satire in some regards

09:15 <+Miura> just wondering what people on here consider decent pay
09:15 < ariqs> depends entirely on what I'm doing for it
09:16 < ariqs> 35k is way more than I need a year to live on
09:16 <+_folti_> ariqs: blowing truckers in the truck stop ? :P
09:18 < ariqs> well, the peculiar thing is... 
09:18 < ariqs> I was talking to Minow
09:18 < ariqs> just under a hour before Miura asked about 35k
09:19 <+Miura> are you implying you gave minow a blowjob 
09:19 < ariqs> no
09:19 < ariqs> I told him
09:19 < ariqs> about a company, CFI
09:19 < ariqs> that told me the average 1st year trucker made 35k/year with them
09:21 < ariqs> so it is strange, Miura
09:21 < ariqs> that you ask about 35k out of the blue like that
09:21 < ariqs> you know?
09:21 <+Miura> what does minow do?
09:21 <+Miura> I forget
09:21 <+Miura> ariqs: it wasn't out of the blue
09:21 <+Miura> did you not read what I said
09:22 < ariqs> I don't see anyone talking about 35k before you
09:22 < Admiral_Skippy> to clarify
09:22 < Admiral_Skippy> apocal raised that figure in a relationship thread on sb
09:22 < ariqs> Minow does nothing, but he's getting 2k/month for schooling for having been in the military 
09:22 < ariqs> ah
09:23 <+Miura> ah
09:24 <+Miura> ariqs: perhaps you should examine the context more
09:24 <+Miura> and what was said after
09:25 < ariqs> I don't click links 
09:25 <+Apocal> yeah, i consider 35K/year decent money
09:25 <+Miura> I think I will take a nap
09:25 <+Miura> Apocal: ah
09:25 <+Twisted_Mentat> " Just shutup and stop posting in this thread. You dare defy the knowledge of Vin Di Carlo?"

09:25 <+Apocal> Troll thread.
09:25 <+Miura> what sort of starting salary are you looking for once you graduate?
09:25 <+Twisted_Mentat> "I don't have those difficulties. I may be a virgin but I have had quite a few CLOSE opportunities that I blew away."
09:25 <+Twisted_Mentat> lol
09:25 <+Twisted_Mentat> yeah, total troll thread
09:26 <+Apocal> Around 60-85K/year starting
09:26 <+Twisted_Mentat> that or deluded
09:26 <+Twisted_Mentat> hard to know the difference
09:26 < Ford_Dylandy> 35k is Tasmanian lawyer entry money.
09:27 < Ford_Dylandy> Amongst professionals it's not much chop given the amount of work that goes into getting admitted
09:27 <+Apocal> also: http://cdn.duelinganalogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Dont-Catch-Em-All.jpg
09:27 <+Miura> wow
09:27 <+Twisted_Mentat> lol
09:27 <+Miura> that's low pay for a lawyer
09:27 <+Apocal> yeah, if i had to go through law school and got only that much i'd... do something other than law...
09:28 < Ford_Dylandy> Comparatively I know one chick who can earn 50k in one day
09:28 <+Apocal> like be a private in the army
09:28 < ariqs> yeah, 35k can be a lot or nothing depending on what it is you have to do for the money
09:29 < ariqs> and I'm not gonna click SB forum links almost always. I don't need that headache :P
09:29 <+Apocal> i consider it decent
09:29 <+Apocal> especially for the typical SB age range of 18-23
09:29 < ariqs> oh yeah
09:29 < ariqs> at that age it's great
09:29 <+Apocal> obviously once you're like 26-29 you start making real bread
09:30 < ariqs> I've only made that much one job in my life
09:31 < ariqs> ofc, I've never been on any track for money making success. 
09:31 < ariqs> is the typical forum posting 18-23 though?
09:32 <+Twisted_Mentat> probably
09:32 <+Apocal> well, the friend of mine who is the most successful in his (non-military, never served) career says to work at a job for a year and then get your resume back together and start looking at an upgrade 
09:32 <+Twisted_Mentat> I'm currently on 53 per annum. 
09:32 < ariqs> this channel the average age is much higher
09:32 <+Apocal> apparently he just goes to his boss and says, "oh i got an offer from company X for Y dollars, how much am i worth to you?"

09:48 <+Apocal> [02:45:39] <ariqs> man, Apocal. You're such a chimp :P  I actually have no desire to drive some luxury car --- Neither do I, but it doesn't mean I'm willing to devalue my own time and effort spent working just so I can feel smarter than a guy who makes more money than me.
09:50 < ariqs> my desire for money is simply insulation from being exploited by worthless users. Users that just want to pomp up with expensive things feeling like "The man" disgust me. I told him his ideas were fucking stupid because I was not going to suffer him wasting my time and aggravating the hell out of me humoring them

11:01 <+_folti_> it still didn't do much good for you to piss him off. telling superiors that they are idiots in way that it doesn't piss them off is one of the better parts of diplomacy
11:01 < ariqs> he was very good at building things, but he didn't build. He managed... primarily because no one could tolerate working with him
11:02 < ariqs> and he had a ton of crazy person energy, and would get this notions that a project that would take months could be done in a day

12:12 <+Lambo> that says everything
12:12 <+Lambo> xbox dev is done with Visual Studio
12:12 <+Lambo> lol
12:13 <+Lambo> PS3 uses Sony's proprietary compiler
12:13 < Ford_Dylandy> Like part of the reason why nobody used CryEngine and everybody used Unreal Engine is that the latter was just so much easier to use
12:13 < Ford_Dylandy> While the former was like getting blood from a stone
12:14 <+Lambo> lol
12:14 <+Lambo> too many games use the Unreal Engine
12:14 <+Lambo> hell, I think mass effect uses it
12:14 <+_folti_> well
12:14 < Apocal> why does the engine they use matter?
12:14 <+Lambo> one less thing they have to write Apocal
12:15 < Apocal> no i mean
12:15 <+_folti_> entry to the pc game development is easy (just get the dev environment and required libs/engines)
12:15 < Apocal> you're saying that "too many games use it"
12:15 <+Lambo> not saying it as a complaint
12:15 < Apocal> oh ok
12:15 <+_folti_> too bad, when the project growws ,you have to factor in the rather fragmented hardware platform
12:15 <+Lambo> I wish more games used Source engine
12:15 <+Lambo> because it's awesome
12:15 <+Lambo> lol
12:15 < Apocal> i never notice which engine the game uses
12:16 < Apocal> except w/e witcher 1 uses
12:16 < Apocal> since it is like 6 years old and still manages to run like shit on my laptop
12:16 <+Lambo> they usually state the engine int he game's opening credits lol
12:16 <+_folti_> Apocal: the engine nowadays is a rather big beast to write all for yourself.
12:16 < Apocal> i know
12:16 < Apocal> im just wondering why the people playing the game would care
12:16 <+Lambo> because for instance
12:16 <+Lambo> the Quake engine
12:17 <+Lambo> has a bug
12:17 <+_folti_> just one ? :D
12:17 < Apocal> unless it is pure shit like w/e witcher 1 runs on
12:17 <+Lambo> where strafe jumping woukld give you infinite speed
12:17 < Apocal> huh?
12:17 <+_folti_> oh that's a constant bug :D
12:17 <+Lambo> almost every Quake engine based game still has that damn bug
12:17 <+Lambo> lol
12:17 < Apocal> and all of the gam-
12:17 <+_folti_> q3 engine had some of those too
12:17 < Apocal> why would the leave that in?
12:17 <+Lambo> Q3 also had that bug.. but it became a sport 
12:17 <+Lambo> lol
12:18 <+Lambo> I used to strafe jump in Quake 3
12:18 <+Lambo> made matches insane lol
12:18 <+_folti_> Apocal: probably because it's rather hard to fix
12:18 < Apocal> dont allow strafe jumping
12:18 <+_folti_> Apocal: or they just don't care
12:18 < Apocal> or that
12:18 <+Lambo> I think half-life has it lol
12:18 <+Lambo> since HL1 was Quake engine based
12:18 <+_folti_> q3 goodness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPRZu-kic0
12:18 <+Lambo> Hl2 doesn't
12:19 <+_folti_> hl2 used different engine
12:19 <+Lambo> but HL2 was Source engine
12:19 <+Lambo> which was similar to HL1 in that the console used the same commands 
12:19 <+Lambo> lol
12:19 <+Lambo> man, I miss dev consoles in games :(
12:20 <+Lambo> but!
12:20 <+Lambo> all source games have them
12:20 <+Lambo> :D
12:20 <+Lambo> it's like a Valve staple lol

12:48 <+_folti_> nah
12:49 <+_folti_> over 60-70 it's practically e-penis.
12:50 <+_folti_> unless there are subtle bugs in the engine, where the fps rate changes how the underlying things work...

13:43 < Thanatos> Some guys blog post about-yeah

While doing this think very sexual thoughts, and she'll know your intentions. This is attractive to her. ALso, looking at her lips signals her that you want to kiss her, so it won't be too much of a surprise.       Another thing is to ask her out quickly. Don't introduce yourself and t

20:08 < ariqs> yeah, I dunno what is wrong with me ;)
20:08  * ariqs just cuddles with utemia and shuts up
20:08 < utemia> and I will not take a kitchen knife and cut my stomach open
20:08 < utemia> lol
20:08 < SeaDart> arias was dispensing relationship advice earlier
20:08 < SeaDart> ariqs
20:09 < utemia> the surface cut is almost completely healed already
20:09 < utemia> ill have the ends of the thread shortened tomorrow
20:09 < ariqs> interesting 
20:09 <+RRoan> stitches?
20:09 < utemia> I had surgery in my abdomen
20:09 < ariqs> SeaDart: my longest relationship with a woman was over a year. How long is yours?
20:09 <+RRoan> Ooh!
20:10 <+RRoan> What did they do?
20:10 <+RRoan> :D
20:10 < SeaDart> Did they take out your appendix
20:10 < ariqs> say something crazy, utemia
20:10 < utemia> cut is across my pelvis right above the pubic hair about 8 inches long
20:10 < ariqs> lets see if she believes it :)
20:10 < utemia> or ca 20 cm
20:10 < SeaDart> I swear to god days please work
20:10 < utemia> they took a benign cyst
20:10 < ariqs> say... they took out a baby that 
20:10 < ariqs> bah
20:10 < utemia> well they said 90% benign
20:11  * ariqs stops cuddling with utemia
20:11 < SeaDart> We can read all that ariqs 
20:11 < utemia> haven't got the results yet
20:11 < ariqs> RRoan has me on ignore, SeaDart
20:11 < utemia> oh but those cysts are great for Science! ariqs
20:11 < ariqs> like almost always I'm thinking steps ahead of you tools ):
20:11 < utemia> since they have stemcells
20:11 < SeaDart> I wonder why
20:11 < ariqs> and hair and teth
20:11 < utemia> and muscles
20:11 < utemia> skin
20:11 < utemia> organs
20:11 < utemia> brain
20:11 < utemia> blood
20:12 < utemia> fat
20:12 < ariqs> what if your tumor was more sentient than you are
20:12 <+_folti_> utemia: and they look to ariqs longingly :P
20:12 < ariqs> was it wrong to have it removed?
20:12 < utemia> lol
20:12 <+_folti_> s/to/at/
20:12 < utemia> that is a freaky thought
20:12 < SeaDart> How can a tumour be intelligent
20:12 < SeaDart> It has no brain
20:12 < utemia> lol
20:12 < SeaDart> *am not scientist*
20:13 < utemia> what i had is a malfunctioning egg that starts to develop all kinds of things
20:13 < SeaDart> I'm sitting here, trying to fix dayZ, and reading lolita on the side
20:13 < SeaDart> Humbert Humbert is an entertaining fellow
20:13 < utemia> so there is a chance that braincells are developed
20:14 < utemia> anyway.
20:14 < SeaDart> A few, sure, but nowhere near that of a human
20:14 < utemia> no
20:14 < utemia> they were joking
20:14 < ariqs> SeaDart needs to reassure himself 
20:14 < utemia> lol
20:14 < SeaDart> Reassure?
20:15 < SeaDart> Ariqs, I humour you. Don't get ahead of yourself.
20:15 <@Grin_Reaper> Jeeze, all this time on the internet and you doubt the existence of intelligent tumors?
20:15 <@Grin_Reaper> They post among us!
20:15 < utemia> lol
20:15 < SeaDart> Radiation's given me a tumour 
20:15 < SeaDart> most likelu
20:15 < utemia> maybe your tumor is the one who doesn't like kids and makes you say it
20:15 < utemia> :(
20:16 <+_folti_> and in your brain
20:16 < SeaDart> I don't know, honestly
20:16 < utemia> think about it
20:16 < utemia> it makes a lot of sense
20:16 < SeaDart> I'm being controlled by a hyper intelligent tumour
20:16 < SeaDart> Fun!
20:17 <+_folti_> or getting debiliated by  one 
20:17 < utemia> that is actually possible
20:17 < SeaDart> I'm getting my fire movement on _folti_ 
20:17 < utemia> as far as I know
20:17 <+_folti_> (my father's brain tumor worked this way. wasn't fun)
20:17 < utemia> yeah that has to be awful

20:25 < Elryn> 34C = ~94F
20:25 <+_folti_> lot's of material that reflects it back
20:25 < utemia> tonight was wonderful though
20:26 <+_folti_> or absorbs it and reflects it back, like concrete and asphalt
20:26 < utemia> after the sun set
20:26 < Elryn> It's about 30C here - relatively low (37%) humidity

21:32 < ariqs> his words have no meaning
21:32 < Admiral_Skippy> ariqs: You just go off into the tall grass sometimes.
21:32 < Commander_598> After this it's two weeks to remind me why I left home followed by a couple months at F18 school in Cali...then a really long flight across the Pacific.
21:32 < Drachyench> I have a mother currently playing phone-tag with everyone she knows because I laughed in her face when she said "White males have the worst unemployment rate in the US"
21:32 < SeaDart> what
21:32 < Admiral_Skippy> SeaDart: It's okay, when she has you under her HEEL OF THE STATE, ADMINISTERING APPROPRIATE JUDICIAL PUNISHMENTS AND REWARDS
21:32 < Drachyench> She's one of "those types"
21:32 < ariqs> what does, "going into the tall grass" mean?

22:08 < EricD> Drogo was just a warlord, not an empire-builder

22:09 < zeit> The same was said of gheghis khan, who he was based on.
22:09 <+Miura> Khan was a pretty face?
22:09 < EricD> Genghis Khan BUILT an empire though
22:09 < EricD> Drogo is far more like Atilla the Hun than anything

22:10 < Drachyench> Do keep in mind that, barring a few characters,
22:10 < Drachyench> The TV series makes most characters more sympathetic
22:10 < Admiral_Skippy> EricD: sure
22:11 < Admiral_Skippy> Acatalepsy: In a better time, yes.
22:11 < Admiral_Skippy> Acatalepsy: But winter is coming : (
22:11 < Acatalepsy> Eh, from what I remember Renly seemed like he might have actually done a decent job.
22:11 < EricD> He betrayed his own brother out of power lust
22:11 < LucusCasius> Renly was a diplomat.
22:11 < LucusCasius> Nothing else.
22:11 < Drachyench> Also, thinking back on it: Jaime losing his hand is much less a "Oh teh horrid monster" moment than many people make it out to be. Remember that "poor Jaime" had, just an episode before, tried to murder his way to freedom a second time (the first time was a successful murder, not-so-successful bid for freedom), has murdered plenty of innocent folks, shoved a small child out a window...
22:11 < EricD> And then after assembling the largest army in the war
22:11 < Acatalepsy> [18:11]	EricD	He betrayed his own brother out of power lust // I'm not sure how that disqualifies one from being King.
22:11 < EricD> He did nothing with it
22:12 < Acatalepsy> He got magic-stabbed in the back, IIRC.
22:12 < EricD> Yes he did

22:12 < EricD> Served him right
22:12 < Admiral_Skippy> a decent choice for  summer king
22:12 < Admiral_Skippy> not much else
22:12 < EricD> And you know, the tragedy of Renly is
22:12 < Falchion> So, Wyzilla...
22:13 < EricD> If he had just supported his brother Stannis loyally
22:13 < EricD> Everything would have been better for him and and most everyone 
22:13 < EricD> Renly wouldn't have been stabbed by a black magic smoke monster
22:13 < EricD> The Tyrells and Baratheons would overthrow the Lannisters
22:13 < EricD> Stannis would sit on the Iron Throne and Renly would probably be his heir
22:14 < EricD> But Renly had to be impatient and greedy because his gay lover told him that people liking him a lot means it's totally cool to betray your own blood and make an unlawful claim on kingship
22:14 < Acatalepsy> [18:13]	EricD	If he had just supported his brother Stannis loyally // Probably, that would have been better for everyone.
22:15 < Acatalepsy> Then again "if people didn't betray people for power" would probably be (mostly) better for everyone.
22:17 < EricD> Well that's why I have very little regard for Renly. 
22:17 < Admiral_Skippy> Acatalepsy: Valid point, lol.
22:17 <@|Minow|> "If Renly had only supported his awful brother, said awful brother wouldn't have had to murder him with creepy sex magic!" :-P
22:17 < EricD> Stannis is a just man
22:17 < EricD> Harsh, but just
22:18 < EricD> He rewards the good and punishes the bad. Renly had committed a crime, the punishment for treason was death. Is it his justice you question, or his methods?
22:19 < Admiral_Skippy> |Minow|: Simple question. Can you honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, that Renly is a strong enough leader to lead humanity to victory in a war for survival against the Others?
22:19 < Admiral_Skippy> Because that's actually the only criterion that matters

22:19 < Acatalepsy> Can you say that for *anyone* ?
22:19 < Admiral_Skippy> and there are reasons i won't spoil why melisandre chose stannis as that man, beyond his the depth of his convictions, integrity, and drive
22:19 <+Miura> "While Worf, Dax, Bashir, Leeta, and Quark vacation on Risa, Worf decides to join a radical fundamentalist group determined to start a political revolution on Risa. "

22:25 < Acatalepsy> Yes. But she also doesn't care.
22:25 <@|Minow|> Admiral_Skippy: no, I can't, and that's why I support Daenerys!

23:03 < Apocal> "the late walder frey old tully called me"
23:03 < Apocal> on account i couldnt get my troops to the trident in time for battle
